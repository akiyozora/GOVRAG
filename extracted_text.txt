About the Style Manual
Use the Style Manual when creating Australian Government content.
The Australian Government Style Manual (Style Manual) is the definitive resource for
Australian Government content.
It helps you put peopleʼs needs at the centre of the content you create. Itʼs the toolkit for
making information easy to read, accessible and inclusive.
The Style Manual is produced and published by the Australian Public Service Commission
(https://www.apsc.gov.au/).
The need for an Australian Government
style manual
People interact with government through content. This includes text on webpages, forms,
videos or images.
A consistent approach to content makes it simpler and faster for people to get things done
with government.
When to use the Style Manual
Use this manual to write, edit, review, or approve Australian Government content. The
guidance applies to all government information, including:07/09/2024, 13:22 About the Style Manual | Style Manual

briefs
policy documents

technical and specialist content
government communications.
User research and continuous
improvement
The Style Manual team continues to test the manual with people who create government
content.
We will base further updates on:
evidence and shifts in Australian style
Australian and international standards for accessibility and readability
insights from ongoing user research
emerging patterns in the feedback we receive.
We welcome your thoughts on the Style Manual. You can get in touch with us by filling out
the feedback form that youʼll find on every page.
Publication history
The Style Manual began with the work of 2 committees established over 60 years ago:
Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary and Government Publications (Joint Select
Committee) – established by resolution of parliament, 6/12/1962 to 13/05/1964
Government Style Manual Committee (GSMC) – established by the Treasurer, 5/12/1962
to 10/12/1964.
In 1965, the Style Manual Committee formed to build on the work of the GSMC. The
committee was chaired by a parliamentarian and its members included experts from the
public service and academia.07/09/2024, 13:22 About the Style Manual | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/about-style-manual 2/4The Style Manual Committee oversaw preparation of the manual and publication of the first
edition in 1966. In his foreword, Prime Minister Harold Holt noted that the manual ‘had its
genesisʼ in the 1964 report of the Joint Select Committee.
That report also recommended the establishment of a parliamentary Joint Committee on
Publications (JCP). Today, the JCPʼs secretariat sits on the Style Manual's Governance Board
as an observer.

Agency responsibilities and commitments (/accessible-and-

Accessibility is a mandatory standard for government agencies. Test your content
against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) success criteria. Agencies
should commit to improving their performance against the standard.07/09/2024, 13:22 Accessible and inclusive content | Style Manual

User needs are at the heart of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
When you take user needs into account, applying accessibility principles becomes
simpler, though not necessarily easier.
Design for accessibility and inclusion (/accessible-and-
inclusive-content/design-accessibility-and-inclusion)
How we design has a direct influence on what we design. Inclusive design means that
the products and services we create work for everyone.
Literacy and access (/accessible-and-inclusive-
content/literacy-and-access)
Literacy can be a barrier to access for Australian users. Writing to an Australian year 7
level makes content usable for most people.
How people read (/accessible-and-inclusive-content/how-
people-read)
Write and design content that matches how users read. Use short sentences and
simple structure.
Inclusive language (/accessible-and-inclusive-

Foreword by the Hon Patrick Gorman MP
Foreword by the Hon Patrick
Gorman MP
Clear and consistent writing is essential. It helps
Australia solve the policy challenges of today and
tomorrow. And it underpins government content and
services that Australians can rely on.
The seventh edition of the Australian Government
Style Manual (Style Manual) is for everyone who
writes, edits or approves Australian Government
content. This is the first digital edition.
The Style Manual was first published in 1966. Then,
the Australian Government had installed just 34
computers.
Today, most public servants carry a computer in their pockets. It has never been easier to
publish and share words with the world. This demands us to take more care over our writing
than ever before.
Caring about every word, every sentence, is important. It is how the public service delivers
frank, honest and timely advice based on the best-available evidence.
The Style Manual is not for the Australian Public Service alone. The manual is for the
Australian people – our audience – who rightly expect clear communication about the policy
and actions of the Australian Government.
That means thinking about our audience every single time we write.07/09/2024, 13:24 Foreword by the Hon Patrick Gorman MP | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/about-style-manual/foreword-hon-patrick-gorman-mp 1/2Put simply, using the Style Manual helps you make an impact.
Happy writing.
The Hon Patrick Gorman MP
Assistant Minister for the Public Service

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/about-style-manual/how-use-style-manual 1/7Style Manual basics
Use the Style Manual to learn how to apply government style to all kinds of content formats.
It tells you how to write and edit user-focused content (/node/76).
Guidance on each page helps you understand how to:
create content for government
use rules and conventions to create consistent content.
You can use the manual for services and products that are designed for end-users (external-
facing content). Itʼs equally applicable to content for government users (internal-to-
government content).
Your organisation might have its own style guide. Check if it is current and refers to the Style
Manual.
Style rules and examples
Youʼll find clear rules and examples throughout the manual.
Use the search box in the header of each page to find the guidance youʼre looking for. Type
your search query into the box to find relevant and related content.
Use the ‘Guidanceʼ headings at the top of each page to identify topics and rules.
Style rules
Each heading leads to a concise statement of guidance. This is a style rule.
Examples
Rules are illustrated by examples. Find examples in a callout box titled ‘Exampleʼ.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/about-style-manual/how-use-style-manual 2/7Paired example boxes
Some examples are presented in pairs to compare what to do and what not to do.
These example boxes have paired headings like:
‘Write thisʼ and ‘Not thisʼ
‘Like thisʼ and ‘Not thisʼ.
Use these paired examples to confirm your understanding of the rule.
Highlighted content
Highlights in example boxes draw attention to the content the rule applies to. Look for
highlights to understand how you should apply the rule in your content.
Square brackets
Some examples are followed by words in square brackets. These words clarify how the
example relates to the rule.
Callouts
Some Style Manual guidance is accompanied by additional highlighted information. These
callouts mean you have other obligations to consider, as well as style.
Accessibility requirements
The Style Manual includes information about accessibility requirements. This information is
sourced directly from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Write this
This is an example box. It shows you how to apply a rule.
Not this

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/about-style-manual/how-use-style-manual 3/7Accessibility callouts explain which elements of WCAG should be considered when creating
different types of content. They give practical advice and a link to more information about
the criteria for accessibility. 
Use the advice to create content that your users can understand.
Information management requirements
Information that you create as part of your work for the Australian Government is a record.
Records provide evidence of what your organisation has done and why. Information
management callouts explain your responsibility to manage and dispose of records.
Privacy requirements
When you handle personal information, you must comply with the Australian Privacy
Principles (https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles). Privacy callouts
explain your legal responsibility when collecting, handling and storing personal information.Example
Accessibility requirements
User need:
I can understand any information contained in an image.
Fundamentals:
Add alternative text for all images. For help with writing good alt text: the
W3C alt text decision tree.
(https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/)
Write alternative text that describes the information or function of the
image. For help to describe images: the W3C/WAI Web accessibility images
tutorial (https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/).

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/about-style-manual/how-use-style-manual 4/7Security classification requirements
Australian Government content is subject to security classification assessment under the
Protective Security Policy Framework (https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/). Security
classification callouts provide resources about applying security classifications and
protective markings.
Digital Service Standard requirements
The Digital Transformation Agencyʼs Digital Service Standard (https://www.dta.gov.au/help-
and-advice/about-digital-service-standard) is a set of criteria for designing and delivering
government services. Digital Service Standards callouts identify criteria from the standard
that might apply to your content. 
Print considerations
Most of the guidance in the Style Manual applies to digital and print formats. There are
particular things to keep in mind when you design content for print. These things appear as
guidance under the heading ‘Print considerationsʼ. The guidance is highlighted so it is easy
to find.

Print considerations
Publishing Easy Read as a PDF means it may be read online or printed. When you
have links in the material, you need to:
provide clear link text and make sure it looks like a link
spell out the URL next to the linked text.07/09/2024, 13:24 How to use the Style Manual | Style Manual

Evidence includes:
data on language usage (corpus)
user research
Australian and international style rules and guidance
best practice in accessibility and readability.
Each page has a form so you can give us feedback. We take your feedback into account
when working on future releases.
Evidence
Some Style Manual pages list evidence sources. Evidence refers to authoritative information
sources that relate directly to a rule.
References
Reference lists contain sources that the authors consulted, not only the sources that
informed the guidance.

How to cite the Style Manual
This style guidance is for Australian Government writers following the manualʼs
referencing and attribution rules. Those outside the Australian Government
might follow other rules.
You donʼt need to cite the Style Manual when you use its guidance to create
content.
Use referencing style for mentions of the
Style Manual
A long-held convention is that titles mentioned in body text follow their equivalent
referencing style. We recommend that Australian Government writers follow the styles
shown in either of the Author–date (https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-
attribution/author-date) and Documentary–note
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/documentary-note) systems.
If you mention the Style Manual in your content, treat it as the name of a website. Follow the
capitalisation style of our website – title case – and use italics. A hyperlink is optional.
Introduce the shortened form ‘Style Manualʼ in parentheses at first mention. Use the
shortened form for later mentions.
Example
The Australian Government Style Manual (Style Manual) contains useful guidance about
apostrophes. The Style Manual also provides accessibility callouts for most topics.07/09/2024, 13:24 How to cite the Style Manual | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/about-style-manual/how-cite-style-manual 1/4When you mention a webpage from the Style Manual in your content, treat it as part of a
larger publication or series. Use sentence case and quotation marks.
Cite the Style Manual using referencing
and attribution rules
Always cite the Style Manual when you paraphrase it or quote it in your content.
The following examples show how to cite the Style Manual website and a webpage in the
manual using Author–date and Documentary–note rules. The rules are:
‘Entire websiteʼ
‘Webpage as part of a larger publication or seriesʼ.
Both rules appear on the Author–date page in ‘Sequence the elements of online sources
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-
date#sequence_the_elements_of_online_sources)ʼ and on the Documentary–note page in
‘Reference all elements of online sources (https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-
attribution/documentary-note#reference_all_elements_of_online_sources)ʼ.
Please also hyperlink the name of our website and any webpages you cite.
Author–date
Author–date is suitable for most government content. This system comprises an in-text
citation and a full citation in the list of references. For the full citation, use italics and title
case for the name of our website. Follow this with our URL.Example
I found the answer in ‘Acronyms and initialisms
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-
words-and-phrases/acronyms-and-initialisms)ʼ.
Example
Initialisms are pronounced as letters and acronyms as words. WofG – meaning ‘Whole of
governmentʼ – is pronounced as ‘double u of geeʼ, so itʼs an initialism, not an acronym
(APSC 2023). [In-text citation]07/09/2024, 13:24 How to cite the Style Manual | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/about-style-manual/how-cite-style-manual 2/4To cite a Style Manual webpage in Author–date, use:
quotation marks for the title of the webpage
sentence case and italics for the name of the publication
title of the website followed by ‘websiteʼ.
Documentary–note
Follow the citation rules in ‘Documentary–noteʼ if you use endnotes or footnotes in your
content. The order of some elements differs from the order shown in Author–date.APSC (Australian Public Service Commission) (2023) Australian Government Style
Manual (https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/), stylemanual.gov.au, accessed 21 February
2023. [Full citation in reference list – cited as a website]
Example
Donʼt use a full stop after a contraction. The only exception is when: ‘the contraction
ends a sentence and isnʼt followed by another punctuation markʼ (APSC 2023). [In-text
citation]

APS Academy training
The APS Academy (https://www.apsacademy.gov.au/) provides training in writing and editing
for Australian Public Service employees. This training is based on the content in the Style
Manual.
The APS Academy is responsible for developing APS Craft
(https://www.apsacademy.gov.au/aps-craft) – the essential skills that public servants need in
order to deliver good policy and services.
Writing is one of the fundamental skills required of APS employees. The APS Academy offers
writing skills workshops for those seeking to:
be more effective at their current level
transition to a new role or level.
Essential writing for APS 1–4 levels (https://www.apsacademy.gov.au/essential-writing-aps-
1-4-levels) highlights the relationship between plain language and accessibility and
readability. It also covers active voice, punctuation and types of lists.07/09/2024, 13:24 Training and professional development | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/about-style-manual/training-and-professional-development 1/3Essential writing for APS 5–6 levels (https://www.apsacademy.gov.au/essential-writing-aps-
5-6-levels) suits all APS and executive level staff who write analytically. It focuses on how to
outline an evidence-based argument and recommend a course of action.
Essential writing for executive levels (https://www.apsacademy.gov.au/essential-writing-

‘Dates and timeʼ has a new structure, revised guidance, new content and updated examples.
To ensure the Changelog is readable, we list major changes only. Minor changes have been
logged internally.
Rule changes
Shortened forms for months and days of the week – We allow more contractions for
use as standard abbreviations: ‘Tueʼ ‘Thurʼ ‘Thuʼ ‘Junʼ ‘Julʼ ‘Sepʼ.07/09/2024, 13:24 Changelog | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/about-style-manual/changelog 1/17World wars – The amended rule replaces the distinction between Australian and
American styles with 2 acceptable styles: ‘First World Warʼ and ‘World War Iʼ. Our
recommendation to use roman numerals is based on corpus evidence, but we
acknowledge the use of ‘1ʼ and ‘2ʼ by some agencies.
There is a rule change for the shortened form. We now recommend using roman
numerals not arabic numerals – write ‘WWIIʼ not ‘WW2ʼ. 
Centuries – Write all centuries with numerals (3rd century). Under the previous rule,
both words (third century) or numerals (3rd century) were acceptable style. Evidence
supporting the change came from expert advice and corpus data.
We have added an exception for centuries to the relevant rule on the ‘Ordinal numbers

Compliance status
This website largely meets Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 level AA
(https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance.html).
The most recent audit (September 2020) was carried out by Intopia with later improvements
checked in April 2021.
A few issues remain:07/09/2024, 13:25 Accessibility statement for the Style Manual | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/about-style-manual/accessibility-statement-style-manual 1/4slight issue with voice over behaviour for menu on iOS mobile devices
occasional minor contrast issues.
APSC is continuing to address these issues through the Style Manual backlog. APSC will
periodically re-evaluate the Style Manual consistent with WCAG recommendations.
Accessibility testing in September 2020 was based on the following combination of assistive
technologies, adaptive strategies, browsers and operating systems:
JAWS-2020 in Chrome 85 on Windows 10
VoiceOver in Safari on iOS 13
keyboard-only navigation in Chrome 85 on Windows 10
high-contrast mode in Chrome 85 on Windows 10.
Style Manual users have identified an issue with how the site displays on IE11 (Internet
Explorer 11). APSC recommends against using IE11 to explore the Style Manual. Microsoft no
longer supports IE11.
Accessibility features
The Style Manual is designed for access on desktops, tablets and mobile devices. The goal
is that anyone can use this website.
You should be able to:
change colours, contrast levels and fonts
zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen
navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions
of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver).
The Style Manual uses plain language so its reading level is no more advanced than the level
attained by year 7 or year 8 (lower secondary education).
The mathematical content uses MathML which works with most screen reader software. To
get the richest experience, NVDA users may like to install the MathPlayer plugin
(http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathplayer/).07/09/2024, 13:25 Accessibility statement for the Style Manual | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/about-style-manual/accessibility-statement-style-manual 2/4Technical specifications
The Style Manual relies on the following technologies to work with the combination of web
browser and assistive technologies or plugins installed on your computer:
HTML
WAI-ARIA
CSS
JavaScript
DOM.
Compatibility with browsers
The Style Manual site works best with the latest browser technology.

Agency responsibilities and commitments
Agency responsibilities and
commitments
Accessibility is a mandatory standard for government agencies. Test your
content against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) success
criteria. Agencies should commit to improving their performance against the
standard.
Use WCAG to guide your agency about
accessibility
‘WCAGʼ stands for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). WCAG 2.2 is the current version. The
Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) released version 2.2 in October 2023.
WCAG is a stable standard to meet specific needs of people with disability. The standard
acknowledges its limitations in meeting needs for people with cognitive and learning
disabilities.
The standard is integrated with Style Manual guidance to help you create inclusive content.
Meet WCAG level AA, but aim higher
Accessibility is a mandatory government standard. WCAG is a baseline accessibility standard
for Australian Government content.07/09/2024, 13:26 Agency responsibilities and commitments | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/agency-responsibilities-and-commitments 1/5Test your content against the WCAG success criteria. You need to meet the level A criteria to
meet level AA.
Your agency will need to make its own assessment about whether content achieves a WCAG
level AA standard. You'll find the WCAG success criteria that relate to any given Style Manual
topic on the relevant page.
Not all level AA success criteria are covered in the Style Manual. You will need to refer to
WCAG to check if there are more criteria to consider for a specific piece of content. 
Aiming higher than the level AA standard will improve usability.
The Style Manual relates the level AAA standard to some topics. This promotes the aim that
government content meets the highest WCAG standard whenever possible.
Include an accessibility statement
An accessibility statement gives users:
information about how youʼve addressed WCAG
information about the technical specifications youʼve tested
evidence of a commitment to accessibility.
For example, your statement might mention how your agency is working on its
implementation of the standard.
Include a page on your site that explains the extent your service or product complies with
WCAG.
You can check how the Style Manual measures up to level AA in its accessibility statement
(/node/12).
Other accessibility guidance and
standards
W3C has a working draft of recommendations that will expand on WCAG: Making content
usable for people with cognitive and learning disabilities (https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-
usable/).07/09/2024, 13:26 Agency responsibilities and commitments | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/agency-responsibilities-and-commitments 2/5You may also need to refer to other relevant W3C standards
(https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/).
For procurements, check Accessibility requirements suitable for public procurement of ICT
products and services (https://infostore.saiglobal.com/en-au/standards/as-en-301-549-
2016-100620_saig_as_as_211428/) (AS EN 301 549 2016). Refer to the digital sourcing
Consider First policy (https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/ict-procurement/digital-
sourcing-framework-ict-procurement/digital-sourcing-policies/digital-sourcing-consider-
first-policy), which applies to non-corporate Commonwealth entities.
Legal and policy frameworks
Accessibility is integral to Australian Government policy for digital transformation, and
written into the Digital Service Standard (https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/about-
digital-service-standard).
Legal requirement
Failure to provide equal access to government services (including information) can be a
failure of obligation under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992
(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A04426).
Australia has obligations under international frameworks, including:
the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
(https://treaties.un.org/Pages/showDetails.aspx?objid=080000028017bf87&clang=_en)
the World Intellectual Property Organization Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to
Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print
Disabled (https://wipolex.wipo.int/en/treaties/textdetails/13169) (Marrakesh Treaty).
These international frameworks are relevant to Australiaʼs domestic policy settings through
the National Disability Strategy (https://www.disabilitygateway.gov.au/ads).

Make content accessible
Make content accessible
People can experience ongoing, temporary or situational barriers to access
information they need. Help them by designing accessible and inclusive
content.
Make content accessible
Accessibility is about inclusion.
Government services and products need to be available to everyone. This means creating
inclusive content.
Inclusive content recognises:
Australiaʼs diversity
the diversity of technology Australians use to engage online.
For example, inclusive content accommodates:
cultural and linguistic diversity among users
diversity of abilities among users
how users interact with technology in different contexts.
The Australian Government's aim is that all government services are digital first. This aim is
described in the Government Digital Strategy (https://www.dta.gov.au/digital-government-
strategy).07/09/2024, 13:25 Make content accessible | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/make-content-accessible 1/4Australian Government digital services must be usable and accessible – a requirement under
the Digital Service Standard (https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/about-digital-service-
standard).  
Follow accessibility guidance in context
Style Manual topics give you the guidance you need to follow to create accessible content.
Where there are specific accessibility requirements or guidance, the Style Manual provides
callouts to make it clear what you need to do.
Example
This is an example of an accessibility callout.
Style Manual guidance
In addition to this contextual guidance, the Style Manual also provides information on:
designing for accessibility and inclusion
applying the principles of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
the responsibilities of government agencies.
This guidance supports agencies in meeting accessibility requirements. The Style Manual
does not provide technical guidance or support for developers and site owners on meeting
specific accessibility requirements.

Apply accessibility principles
Apply accessibility principles
User needs are at the heart of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(WCAG). When you take user needs into account, applying accessibility
principles becomes simpler, though not necessarily easier.
Use WCAG principles to meet user needs
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 guidelines can be expressed as user
needs. These needs feature throughout the Style Manual. The following lists group user
needs (guidelines) under WCAG principles.
Principle: content is perceivable
Any user can perceive the content.
User needs:
I can understand any information contained in an image. (Guideline: text alternatives
(https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#text-alternatives))
I can access equivalent information to anything contained in a video or audio file.
(Guideline: time-based media (https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#time-based-media))
I can change the contentʼs presentation without losing information or structure.
(Guideline: adaptable (https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#adaptable))
I can easily control how I see and hear distinctions if colour or sound convey meaning.
(Guideline: distinguishable (https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#distinguishable))07/09/2024, 13:26 Apply accessibility principles | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/apply-accessibility-principles 1/5Principle: content is operable
Any user can operate the navigation and interface.
User needs:
I can operate the content using only a keyboard. (Guideline: keyboard accessible
(https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#keyboard-accessible))
I can control any features that involve timing so I have enough time to read and use the
content. (Guideline: enough time (https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#enough-time))
I can use the content without experiencing a seizure or physical reaction. (Guideline:
seizures and physical reactions (https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#seizures-and-
physical-reactions))
I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.
(Guideline: navigable (https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#navigable))
I can operate the webpage with something other than a keyboard, like a pointer.
(Guideline: input modalities (https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#input-modalities))
Principle: content is understandable
Any user can understand the information and the interface.
User needs:
I can read and understand text, even if the content includes unusual words and
shortened forms,or features languages other than English. (Guideline: readable
(https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#readable))
I can predict the webpageʼs appearance and how I will operate the content. (Guideline:
predictable (https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#predictable))
I can avoid making any mistakes with my inputs, and correct any that I might make.
(Guideline: input assistance (https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#input-assistance))
Principle: content is robust
Assistive technologies can interpret the content.
User need: I have confidence the markup language supports my use of software and
assistive technology to access the content. (Guideline: compatible

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/apply-accessibility-principles 2/5Follow Style Manual guidance on
accessibility requirements
Look for accessibility requirements as you check guidance for different topics.
Callout boxes in the Style Manual relate user needs to fundamental actions you can take to
ensure content is accessible by design.
Callouts also include references to WCAG criteria that link to technical details (level A, level
AA and level AAA success criteria).
The Style Manual also includes links to other external resources about accessibility.

Design for accessibility and inclusion
Design for accessibility and
inclusion
How we design has a direct influence on what we design. Inclusive design
means that the products and services we create work for everyone.
Design for all
The idea of ‘design for allʼ has its roots in human-computer interaction studies. This body of
knowledge offers practical methods to improve peopleʼs experience of digital content.
The Style Manual promotes some of these methods, in line with the Digital Service Standard
(https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/about-digital-service-standard), such as:
understanding needs through user research (https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-
advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/1-understand-user-
needs)
embedding accessibility as a foundation (https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-
advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/9-make-it-accessible)
using consistent and responsive design (https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-
advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/6-consistent-and-
responsive-design).
The goal is inclusive design that meets a diverse range of needs. Inclusive design considers
user experience in a range of situations – for example, on different devices and for time-poor
users.07/09/2024, 13:26 Design for accessibility and inclusion | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/design-accessibility-and-inclusion 1/5Do user research
Find out more about user research for content (/node/76). This aspect of inclusive design is
core to Style Manual guidance.
As part of your user research, test content to gain:
input from the users youʼre designing for
views and feedback from a diverse and representative users.
You can make content accessible for one user, but it will benefit others in different situations.
For example, user research can help you understand:
a person who uses their mobile and needs simple menu options
a time-poor executive who needs content thatʼs easy to scan
a person who needs to fill in a form, but English is not their first language.
Accessibility is a common thread in each of these situations.
Combine your user research with accessibility techniques to design usable content. 
Ask what makes content usable
Usability and accessibility are closely linked. People will use content that accommodates
their needs (usable content). They turn away from content that is alienating or frustrating to
use.
Accessible content is a foundation to address broader user needs. For example, page
structure feeds into assistive technology. But good page structure also improves readability.
You can think of accessibility as a necessary step to create usable content.
Consider a user who cannot perceive images and the content provides no description, such
as alt text (/node/49). In this situation, visual content is not usable because it is not
accessible.07/09/2024, 13:26 Design for accessibility and inclusion | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/design-accessibility-and-inclusion 2/5Create content for people with diverse
abilities
People can experience difficulties with access because of ongoing, temporary and
situational barriers. Government content needs to be designed so it does not create barriers
to access.
Poor design causes people to experience ongoing, temporary or situational difficulties. This
can limit the extent and duration of access to online content in many ways. 
Accessibility is how you can avoid setting up barriers for people with diverse abilities.
When you design content, it needs to serve people with:
age-related conditions
changing abilities
disability
health issues
cognitive, neurological and learning disabilities.
Usable content accommodates this range of human experience.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/design-accessibility-and-inclusion 3/5Content Guide had an overview on accessibility that referred to specific success criteria in
WCAG.

Literacy and access
Literacy and access
Literacy can be a barrier to access for Australian users. Writing to an Australian
year 7 level makes content usable for most people.
Literacy affects access to government
services and information
Literacy is a personʼs ability to read and write. It is also how well they can access written text
in digital and print formats.
The effect of literacy on peopleʼs lives is profound. It influences how they interact with each
other and how they approach education, work and government.
Low literacy can make it hard to access government services and information.
Factors that affect literacy in English include:
where people live
their linguistic background (/node/59)
their education
how old they are
their abilities and limitations (/node/69)
how they access information.07/09/2024, 13:26 Literacy and access | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/literacy-and-access 1/8Accessibility requirements
User need:
I can read and understand text, even if the content includes unusual words, shortened
forms, or features languages other than English.
Fundamentals:
Write in plain language. This helps all users and is essential for some.
Level AAA requires a lower secondary education reading level, after removal of
proper names and titles (year 7 or between 12 and 14 years old).
Avoid (or explain) unusual words, phrases, idioms and so on.
Expand all acronyms on their first use.
Avoid using double negatives.

Reading levels in Australia
‘Reading levelʼ is the level of education someone needs to be able to read text. It is one way
to measure literacy.
In Australia:
about 44% of adults read at literacy level 1 to 2 (a low level)
38% of adults read at level 3
about 15% read at level 4 to 5 (the highest level).
People at a reading level 1 read at a primary school equivalent level. They can understand
short sentences.07/09/2024, 13:26 Literacy and access | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/literacy-and-access 2/8Australian adult reading levels
Reading level Percentage of adults at each level (%)
Pre-primary level (below level 1)  . 
Pre-year 1 to year 6 (level 1)   . 
Year 7 to year 10 (level 2)   . 
Years 11 and 12 (level 3)   . 
Certificate IV (level 4)   . 
Diploma and above (level 5)  . 
Note: Percentages do not add to 100.
Sources: Reading level statistics are from ABS (2013). Australian school-level equivalents for
each OECD classification level are from ABS et al. (2017).
Education and literacy
People with higher literacy – as measured by reading level – generally have had access to a
better education.
Many factors influence peopleʼs access to education, including where they live.
Post-school education is easier to access if you live in a major city. For example, people in
cities are more likely to have a bachelor degree than people in regional areas. But there are
also areas of disadvantage in the major cities.
An education doesnʼt guarantee a reading level that matches the qualification. For example,
about 30% of Australians have a diploma or higher, but only 1.2% of Australians can read at
that level.
Many people maintain their high-school reading level even if they go on to tertiary studies.07/09/2024, 13:26 Literacy and access | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/literacy-and-access 3/8Clear content helps all users
Regardless of literacy levels, all users want to be able to interact with government easily.
Respect their time by writing in plain language (/node/55). Check that your content is a
reading level 2 (Australian year 7 equivalent). This level also helps users with higher literacy. 
Users with higher education also prefer content thatʼs easy to read. People with the highest
literacy levels tend to be time-poor and have the most to read. The preference for plain
English increases with:
a personʼs level of education
the complexity of the topic.
Content for general consumption needs to be accessible by everyone, regardless of literacy.
Specialist content is more accessible for technical users when written in plain language.
Understanding users
Before you start writing, do user research (/node/76). Donʼt assume that everyone can
access, read and understand what you write.
Always make it simple for people to get what they need to do with government done. People
might need an alternative to the digital service.
Digital Service Standard requirements
You must understand the needs of all users of your service and create content they
can access to meet the Digital Service Standard:
Criterion 1. Understand user needs (https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-
advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/1-understand-
user-needs)
Criterion 9. Make it accessible (https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-
service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/9-make-it-accessible).
Ensure that people who use the digital service can also use the other available
channels, if needed, without repetition or confusion.
Do user research to understand how people interact with government services or
information. Ensure users with low literacy have equal access.07/09/2024, 13:26 Literacy and access | Style Manual

How people read
How people read
Write and design content that matches how users read. Use short sentences
and simple structure.
Simple language, structure and design
helps all users
To create usable content, take into account how people read and what makes content easy
to read.
You can increase usability with:
legible page design
readable language
comprehensible structure.
People read text in different ways. How they read depends on:
how well they already understand the subject
how familiar the vocabulary is.
Digital Service Standard requirements
You must understand the needs of all users of your service and create content they
can access to meet the Digital Service Standard:07/09/2024, 13:26 How people read | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/how-people-read 1/10Criterion 1. Understand user needs (https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-
advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/1-understand-
user-needs)
Criterion 9. Make it accessible (https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-
service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/9-make-it-accessible).
People skim headings and page
structure
To help people understand the type of content, use a clear structure (/node/75).
People want to find the information they need. They skim over the headings to find
‘signpostsʼ that confirm the content is relevant. Before reading the text, they look at other
elements such as:
headings
links
images
tables
lists.
Layout and typography are also important. A clear visual structure with an easy-to-read font
is quicker to scan and read.
The way people read content on a screen is different to how they read in print.
On a smaller screen, such as a phone, people are likely to scan the entire screen before
focusing on text or other elements. On other devices, people usually start at the centre of
the screen and scan to the left and to the right. Structure the page to make the most useful
content stand out.
If people are looking for specific information, they are likely to scan the text as a whole to
find what they need. They will look for links, a specific term, a number or an address. For this
reason, present information in an accepted pattern such as:
an address block
underlined hyperlinks.07/09/2024, 13:26 How people read | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/how-people-read 2/10Accessibility requirements
User needs:
I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.
I can change the content's presentation without losing information or structure.
Fundamentals:
Write clear page titles. This is the first thing a screen reader user will hear and
should align with the first heading on the page.
Organise content with a clear structure using section headings. Describe the
topics or the following section in the heading.
Make sure users can navigate through all content in the intended order,
regardless of the technology they're using. Use the same navigation elements
across the service.
Donʼt rely on colour alone to structure pages.
Donʼt rely on sensory characteristics such as shape, size, visual location,
orientation or sound to explain things.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/how-people-read 3/10Print considerations
People read print content more thoroughly. On a double page of print without any
headings or images, people usually read from top left to bottom right.
When theyʼre reading non-fiction, people need headings to help them find
information. They also scan illustrations, tables, headings and other elements before
reading the text. Often they do this in a sweeping curve counterclockwise from the top
right before they decide what, if anything, to read.
Content with too many unfamiliar words
slows readers down
Some readers can scan text and quickly find what they need. They donʼt focus on every
word. Instead, they take in all the meaning at once. As a result, they donʼt need to read
individual words such as ‘theʼ to understand a sentence (but they see all the words).
Other readers have to work harder to understand individual words. They will find reading
easier if you use more familiar words.
Familiar words that are spelled as they sound are easier to read than unfamiliar words that
are not spelled as they sound.
People read more slowly if they find:
too many unfamiliar words
too many long words
unfamiliar or complex sentence structures.
If the content is difficult, people slow down and focus on unfamiliar words. They might
backtrack to try to understand the meaning. This can cause difficulty with comprehension.
Complex sentences are hard to read
Complex sentences are harder to read than simple ones.07/09/2024, 13:26 How people read | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/how-people-read 4/10People pay attention to content only for as long as they need to. They are not likely to read
everything.
People will take seconds to decide from the page title and first few headings if the content is
relevant.
Once people are on a page, they might scan only a fifth of the content before deciding
whether to read in detail.
Accessibility requirements
User needs:
I can read and understand text, even if the content includes unusual words, shortened
forms, or features languages other than English.
Fundamentals:
Write in plain language. This helps all users and is essential for some.
Level AAA requires a lower secondary education reading level, after removal of
proper names and titles (year 7 or between 12 and 14 years old).
Avoid (or explain) unusual words, phrases, idioms and so on. Expand all
acronyms on their first use.
Avoid using double negatives

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/how-people-read 5/10Rhythm changes can help or hinder
reading
People need to be able to read as smoothly and quickly as possible. They build a rhythm as
they read a line of text. They automatically go to the beginning of the next line and begin
reading.
Help people build reading rhythm with:
short sentences
new paragraphs (/node/53)
line breaks.
Varying rhythm can help or hinder comprehension.
Sentence length
Short sentences are easier to read because they limit the scope of an idea. But most readers
like the variety and rhythm of a mixture of sentence lengths. For most readers, aim for an
average sentence length of 15 words per sentence. Long sentences should have no more
than 25 words.
Paragraphs and line breaks
Paragraphs give people a rest before launching into a new idea. They also help people
quickly find an idea in the writing.
Line breaks also package information. Used well, they are an effective way to keep people
focused and interested.
Line breaks are used to:
help people focus on one idea at a time
draw attention to a point – this is why a paragraph of one short sentence can be so
effective.Example
Short sentences are great. But not always. Vary sentence length. It helps people stay
engaged.07/09/2024, 13:26 How people read | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/how-people-read 6/10Line breaks disrupt the eye as it moves along a line. Poorly used line breaks either:
break ideas in the wrong place – for example, by creating too many short lines
let ideas run together – for example, by creating long lines.
Variations in rhythm
Variations need to support comprehension. For example, you can use a change of rhythm for
emphasis: to make a point or draw the reader's attention to a certain word.
You can vary rhythm using:
headings, lists and other elements that give structure (/node/75)
punctuation marks (/node/119)
parenthetical information – set off using brackets (/node/111), commas (/node/109) or
dashes (/node/199).
Each of these variations can interrupt a reading rhythm.
Reading rhythm is also interrupted by:
unfamiliar words
capital letters (/node/116)
changes in font or typeface, such as italics (/node/187)
images (/node/46).
Any variation or interruption in rhythm can affect comprehension.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/how-people-read 7/10The sixth edition had information on how people find information online and in print. It
included information on indexing that is not part of the digital editionʼs Live release.
The digital edition omits some information from the sixth edition on eye movement.
The sixth edition explained how readers absorb information. It included information about
context and patterning, attention spans, style and layout, and images (called ‘illustrationsʼ).
It referred to the use of moving images to get usersʼ attention. This information sits on other
pages in the digital edition, which are linked to types of structure.
The Content Guide did not address this topic, but had related information on writing for
search engines and navigation labels.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples
Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander peoples
Use culturally appropriate and respectful language when writing with, for or
about First Nations people.
There is no single Aboriginal or Torres
Strait Islander identity
First Nations people are often called Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. But there
is significant diversity within these 2 groups.
There is a wide range of nations, cultures and languages across mainland Australia and
throughout the Torres Strait. Given this diversity, respectful language use depends on what
different communities find appropriate.
‘Aboriginalʼ is a broad term that groups nations and custodians of mainland Australia and
most of the islands, including Tasmania, Kʼgari, Palm Island, Mornington Island, Groote
Eylandt, Bathurst and Melville Islands.
‘Torres Strait Islanderʼ is a broad term grouping the peoples of at least 274 small islands
between the northern tip of Cape York in Queensland and the south-west coast of Papua
New Guinea. Many Torres Strait Islander peoples live on the Australian mainland. There are
also 2 Torres Strait Islander communities at Bamaga and Seisia, within the Northern
Peninsula Area of Queensland.07/09/2024, 13:27 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/inclusive-language/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-peoples 1/13Authoritative guidance lives with the
relevant community or individual
There is a legacy of writing about First Nations people without seeking their guidance about
references and terminology. Educational texts and official websites can be inaccurate when
written without consultation.
Itʼs important to consult with traditional owners, local elders, community and content
experts. Consultation is essential when writing about sensitive matters like cultures and
history.
Consultation protocols and respectful language use depend on the preferences of the
peoples involved. As a result, there are very few hard rules. Respectful content and language
use will always depend upon proper consultation.
Respectful language use starts with the
basics
Basic respectful language means using:
specific terms, like the name of a community, before using broader terms
plurals when speaking about collectives (peoples, nations, cultures, languages)
present tense, unless speaking about a past event
empowering, strengths-based language.
Language that can be discriminatory or offensive includes:
shorthand terms like ‘Aborigines', ‘Islandersʼ or acronyms like ‘ATSIʼ
using terms like ‘mythʼ, ‘legendʼ or ‘folkloreʼ when referring to the beliefs of First Nations
people
blood quantums (for example, ‘half-casteʼ or percentage measures)
‘us versus themʼ or deficit language
possessive terms such as ‘ourʼ, as in ‘our Aboriginal peoplesʼ
‘Australian Indigenous peoplesʼ, as it also implies ownership, much like ‘ourʼ.
Many texts have referred to First Nations people in the past tense, for example:07/09/2024, 13:27 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/inclusive-language/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-peoples 2/13‘The Aboriginal language existed for hundreds of years.ʼ
‘Torres Strait Islanders once congregated at this place.ʼ
This use of past tense continues the historical erasure of First Australians.
The 2 statements also show a lack of understanding about diversity within either group.
Statements to redress the historical erasure and inaccuracy would read:
‘There is no such thing as “the Aboriginal language”, it would be like saying “the
European language”. There are literally hundreds of First Nations languages that exist
today, and have been spoken for millennia.ʼ
‘The people of Iama (Yam Island) in the Torres Strait have been living there for
thousands of years.ʼ
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have always been here. They are still
undertaking cultural activities. Be conscious of this and work to change the habit.
A Welcome to Country is not the same as an
Acknowledgement of Country
Welcome to Country is an important ceremony for many First Australians. An
Acknowledgement of Country is a way of showing respect. Both are distinct practices with
different requirements and meanings. Always capitalise both.
A Welcome to Country is a ceremony to welcome people onto the land of the custodians. A
local traditional owner performs a Welcome to Country. The welcome can take many forms. It
might offer safe passage to visitors or outline any responsibilities while on country. Providing
a Welcome to Country is a paid service. A traditional owner can assign a proxy if they are
unable to attend unexpectedly, though this is rare.
An Acknowledgement of Country is something anyone can do. It is a way a person of any
descent can pay respect to the local community and nation(s). It acknowledges the
custodians of the land on which a meeting is being held. And it recognises the local
communityʼs ongoing connection to, and care for, country. Some organisations also include
acknowledgements in email signatures, websites and other materials.
Both are simple but important ways of paying respect. They redress the erasure of Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander peoples on their own lands.07/09/2024, 13:27 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/inclusive-language/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-peoples 3/13First Nations diversity is reflected
throughout Australia
Most Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples live in urban places. Historical stereotypes
of ‘traditionalʼ peoples are inaccurate and can be offensive.
A common misconception is if people have fair skin or live in a city they canʼt be a First
Nations person. This could not be more wrong. For a long time, policies dictated to
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who they could marry, and where they could
live. Terms like ‘half-casteʼ or ‘part Aboriginalʼ reflect these policies. These terms are deeply
offensive and hurtful.
Peoples were also forcibly removed to other locations. In every location in Australia, remote,
regional or urban, there are traditional custodians. There may also be many different peoples
currently living there. When writing about any particular place, make sure to be inclusive of
all First Nations people living on country.
Naming protocols are complicated,
specificity is often more respectful
Always ask for peopleʼs preferences about what they want to be called or how they want to
identify. It is usually more respectful to be specific.
Use the following hierarchy based on what you are writing.
If writing about:
a specific group, use their nation, island or community name
many Aboriginal nations, there may be a regional term that is better, such as ‘Murrisʼ or
‘Koorisʼ
many Torres Strait Islander peoples or islands, there may be a regional term that is
more appropriate, such as Kulkalgal (encompassing the central islands of Masig,
Poruma, Warraber and Iama)
both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, use terms such as ‘First Nations
peopleʼ, ‘First Australiansʼ or ‘Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander peoplesʼ.07/09/2024, 13:27 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/inclusive-language/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-peoples 4/13The issue with general terms and when to use them
‘Indigenousʼ and ‘Aboriginalʼ are broad terms imposed on First Australians without
consultation. These are not words they chose for themselves.
While the term ‘Indigenous Australiansʼ is in common use, many First Australians may not be
comfortable with it.
Using ‘Indigenous Australiansʼ to refer to First Australians is relatively recent. Its use became
popular through international discussions, where the term ‘indigenousʼ is appropriate (with a
lower case ‘iʼ). But it is a blanket term that homogenises a wide array of peoples and
cultures. This can cause offence.
Due to the common use of ‘Indigenous Australiansʼ in our society, there may be times when
you canʼt avoid the term. It can come up in discussions with government organisations, in
the names of some organisations or in grant applications.
If you must use it, remember to only do so when writing generally about Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander peoples. The term should always appear as ‘Indigenous Australiansʼ in
the first instance, always with a capital ‘Iʼ. Afterward you can use ‘Indigenousʼ, capitalised, so
long as the context is correct and clear. Using ‘Indigenousʼ alone is inaccurate.
Some people use Aboriginal ‘and/orʼ Torres Strait Islander. This is a good idea when the
audience isnʼt clear or specific. Itʼs also important to realise that some individuals identify
with both groups.Example
‘Indigenous Australiansʼ is a broad term and covers a large array of peoples. Often
Indigenous peoples themselves do not identify using this term, they will use their local
community, island or language group.
Indigenous peoples also have regional terms that they use for specific geographical
locations, such as ‘palawaʼ or ‘Noongarʼ to name a couple.07/09/2024, 13:27 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/inclusive-language/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-peoples 5/13Style for First Australian languages
needs to recognise continuing cultures
Hundreds of distinct First Nations languages and dialects are alive and spoken today. Never
refer to them as ‘extinctʼ. Many communities are working to revive their languages. The
preferred term to describe these languages is ‘sleepingʼ.
Spelling
Written sources are often viewed as ‘betterʼ or more ‘reliableʼ in Australia. But spellings for
words from First Australian languages are inconsistent across many sources.
Many colonial attempts to document First Nations languages and cultures introduced
inaccuracy and misrepresentation. This includes inaccurate spellings for names, nations and
locations.
First Nations cultures are oral-based traditions. Oral sources must have precedence. Follow
the spellings that local traditional owners, elders or community members use for words from
their languages.
Consultation is essential. You can use a style sheet to record terms you have checked with
the relevant community.
Italics
Do not italicise names or words from First Nations languages. They are Australian languages,
not foreign languages.
Capitalisation and meaning
There are few firm rules for capitalisation, as different peoples have their own preferences.
Always ask the relevant communityʼs preferences and usages, and follow their advice.
Many First Nations people have developed their own dialects of English as well as
creole/Kriol languages. This means common nouns used in Standard Australian English can
shift into proper nouns at times.
The information on this page follows the convention of minimal capitalisation. But there are
many First Australians who have their own preferences, and these should always take
precedence.07/09/2024, 13:27 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/inclusive-language/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-peoples 6/13Examples of words that are sometimes capitalised include Elders, Country or Traditional
Custodians. Important cultural practices are also capitalised. For example,
Acknowledgement of Country and Welcome to Country.
Some words in Standard Australian English sound the same in Aboriginal English dialects and
in Torres Strait dialects, such as Yumpla Tok. But the meaning can be very different. Words
like deadly, country, elder and law are good examples.
Listen carefully to the context these words are being placed in and ask for clarity if you need
it.
First Nations spirituality is easily
misused or misrepresented
Some First Australiansʼ beliefs are being used in disrespectful ways. For example, the use of
ancestral beings such as the Rainbow Serpent, or Wandjinas as a characters in
‘fictionalʼ stories, art or other forms of media. Most often they are used without permission,
and portrayed in deeply hurtful ways.
Sometimes wider Australian society has denigrated these beliefs. For example, climbing
Uluru in direct contradiction to requests from the traditional custodians not to do so.
Both instances show a lack of understanding or respect for othersʼ beliefs. And
unfortunately, thereʼs a legacy of willful ignorance in this country that is only now being
addressed. As with any religion or spiritual belief, words like ‘mythʼ or ‘legendʼ are minimising
and hurtful.Example
For Standard Australian English, ‘dreamingʼ has a very particular meaning. For some
Aboriginal peoples, there is also another meaning.
Within some communities, the Dreaming means something very different. It refers to a
range of systems of spiritual beliefs. This term is complex. It should always be
capitalised when used in this way.
Some peoples still use ‘the Dreamtimeʼ. But, it has fallen out of use with many, as it
implies a timeframe or ‘pastʼ, which is not accurate.
Some peoples use terms that donʼt have an English equivalent.07/09/2024, 13:27 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/inclusive-language/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-peoples 7/13It is not necessary to believe in or understand someone elseʼs beliefs to be respectful of
them.
Strengths-based language respects
continuous cultures and connections
Content about First Nations people has often focused on ‘problemsʼ. This has 2 outcomes:
making First Australians ‘the problemʼ or continuing a deficit discourse. Neither is
acceptable.
Itʼs important to acknowledge the many wrongs and ongoing injustices that stem from our
shared history. And it's not about ignoring issues. But it is just as important to acknowledge
the strength of those First Australians whose cultures survive and thrive today.
Make sure to:
Use empowering, strengths-based language.
Tell positive stories.
Emphasise ongoing connections to community, culture and country.
The difference between 2 outcome statements above:Example
A bunyip is a being that many Aboriginal peoples believe is real. Yet many Australians
speak of it using terms such as ‘mythʼ or ‘legendʼ. They also use it without permission,
and appropriate it for their own purposes. Appropriating othersʼ beliefs and treating
them in this way is disrespectful.
Write this
The program supports First Nations people to achieve their goals.
Not this

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/inclusive-language/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-peoples 8/13The first has a strengths-based emphasis.
The latter perpetuates a deficit discourse.
Be careful not to perpetuate patronising or paternalistic language use. Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander peoples and cultures are millennia old. They are not ‘in needʼ of being
‘rescuedʼ or ‘savedʼ.
It is about working together, not doing things ‘for themʼ or ‘to themʼ. Also, setting up a
dichotomy of ‘us' and ‘themʼ perpetuates division and exclusion. This language use is not
acceptable.
Consultation is a must
Consultation starts with elders of any given community. They might not be living on their
traditional lands, or there might be multiple groups to consult.
If itʼs not clear who you need to talk to, there are many community organisations that exist
today and can help. These include land councils, housing, medical, legal or social
organisations.
These groups will likely have a direct link to traditional owners and/or elders they can help
you contact.
There is clear information about communities within the region on the Torres Strait Regional
Authority's website (http://www.tsra.gov.au/). They are able to do this because it is a
geographically small area.
Mainland Australia is much larger, and there is no single body that can offer guidance for all
communities.
Cross-cultural communication is not easy. Some basic starting points include:
Communicate clearly without jargon or acronyms.
Understand that community concerns will take precedence over your request.
Make sure to build in plenty of time around the request to support this. When receiving
a response, listen. Body language is also important, so pay attention to what is not said.
Understand that silence is an important part of First Australians communication.
Do your research.07/09/2024, 13:27 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/inclusive-language/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-peoples 9/13It is normal to want to avoid offending or upsetting people. In any process mistakes will
happen. If this occurs, you might have to ask for clarity. Do not rush to fill any silence. Listen
closely, apologise and try to learn from it.
When working in this manner, always give the group final control. Make sure to return
whatever is taken from the community, or ensure a returned benefit. This includes
knowledge and stories.
For full guidance around consultation visit AIATSIS Ethical Research Guidelines
(https://aiatsis.gov.au/research/ethical-research).
Forming a working relationship with a specific group is wonderful. But understand that this
does not translate into knowledge about any other groups.
Working with content experts, such as a First Nations editor or liaison officer, is invaluable.
People in these roles can play an important role as a cultural translator.
Sorry business
Sorry business is an important grieving process when someone passes. It involves not only
immediate family, but the entire community.
If a person has passed, approval must be sought from the family around the use of their
name and image. There might be some avoidance protocols you need to adhere to.
Some communities are okay these days with the use of a name, an image, or both. Others
still request the use of neither. The community will have a way to refer to someone in this
case and can give guidance.
Always adhere to these requirements for all community members. If in doubt, ask.
Australian audiences are familiar with standard warnings about use of names, images or
voices of deceased people in many publications and media. This is a respectful
acknowledgement of sorry business practices and beliefs, and is meant to warn others.
Using a standard warning does not replace respectful consultation with the community.
Permissions
The permissions process is vital and differs from standard copyright procedures. As well as
consulting with elders and/or traditional owners, there are other steps to take. When seeking
permissions for the use of any item, individuals sometimes need to provide approvals too.07/09/2024, 13:27 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/inclusive-language/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-peoples 10/13This is not a firm rule, but one example of how things can change. Always follow the
guidance of the appropriate elders or community members.
Use of images
Many historical images lack any contextual information. It can be impossible to trace the
names of peoples or locations that feature in the images. As a result, it can be inappropriate
and offensive to publish them. Avoid using photographs where people are unnamed.
Illustrations and photographs should include diverse, dynamic and contemporary
representations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Visual representations will
depend on context. Just like use of terms in text, images should be specific to the particular
nation, region or community that relates to the content.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/inclusive-language/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-peoples 11/13The digital edition recommends against use of italics for names or words from Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander languages. This departs from stylistic convention: ‘borrowedʼ words
(not absorbed into Australian English) are otherwise italicised.
This page was updated in June 2023 when the term ‘First Nations Australiansʼ was replaced
by ‘First Nations peopleʼ. This reflects a change in language usage.

Age diversity
Refer to age only if it is necessary. Use respectful language and consistent style
if age is relevant.
If age is relevant, follow style
conventions
Question whether age is relevant. Avoid referring to a personʼs age or an age group if itʼs not
relevant.
If you need to mention age, follow style conventions:
When the reference to age comes before a noun, punctuate it with hyphens
(/node/105). 
Unless the age reference begins a sentence, use numerals (/node/198).
Example
A 39-year-old man faces court today on several charges.
You can withdraw your super once youʼre 65, even if youʼre still working.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/inclusive-language/age-diversity 1/5Use respectful terms when you write
about age
Avoid characterising age references when itʼs not strictly relevant.
Standalone words in everyday use, like ‘oldʼ and ‘youngʼ, can carry bias or unintended
subtext. Words that carry stereotypes, for example ‘elderlyʼ, are not acceptable.
When an age or age range is relevant to a fact, you can use the term ‘peopleʼ with the age
reference.
Inclusivity requirements
Use respectful and inclusive language that talks to the person, not their difference. Itʼs
the law.
Commonwealth laws include:

Young people
The most neutral term is ‘young peopleʼ. ‘Youthʼ is a gender-neutral term and is also
acceptable.
Be careful using the plural ‘youthsʼ. This is often used to refer to male youths only and may
carry other connotations.
Depending on the context, you can use the words ‘adolescentsʼ, ‘childrenʼ and ‘babiesʼ. ‘Kidsʼ

relevant.
Tertiary students can be many ages. Refer to them simply as ‘studentsʼ or, in the case of PhD
students, as ‘PhD candidatesʼ.
Avoid using ‘mature-age studentʼ unless it is relevant to what you are writing.

Cultural and linguistic diversity
Cultural and linguistic diversity
Australians have different cultural backgrounds and speak many languages.
Use inclusive language that respects this diversity.
Speak to the person, not their difference
Use inclusive language. You can use the general term ‘multicultural communitiesʼ to write
about people from different cultural backgrounds.
People writing for government sometimes use the term ‘culturally and linguistically diverseʼ
(CALD) communities. Avoid using the acronym unless youʼre speaking to a specialist
audience.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/inclusive-language/cultural-and-linguistic-diversity 1/5Mention peopleʼs cultural affinity or identity only when you need to.
Australians speak many different languages and have different cultural and religious
beliefs. Each culture has its own values and beliefs. You can be sensitive to these differences
when you write, through doing user research (/node/76).
Avoid using words such as ‘ethnic Australiansʼ or ‘ethnic groupsʼ. This can imply that migrant
heritage or migrant status is unusual. 
Refer to people living in Australia as
‘Australiansʼ
The meaning of the word ‘Australianʼ can vary in different contexts. It could mean anyone
who lives in Australia. Legally, it could mean only people who are Australian citizens.
Depending on the type of content, you might need to explain what you mean by the term.
For example, ‘Australian studentsʼ could refer to all students in Australia including
international students.
Mention heritage, cultural or other national identity only if itʼs necessary. Consult guidance
on how to refer to nationalities, peoples and places outside of Australia
(/node/133#write_nationalities_peoples_and_places_with_initial_capitals).
When you specify a dual identity or other heritage as an adjective, connect the
reference and the term ‘Australianʼ with an en dash (/node/199).
Write this

[Dual identity expressed as an adjective

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/inclusive-language/cultural-and-linguistic-diversity 2/5To refer to people who have recently arrived in Australia, use the words:
‘migrantsʼ
‘immigrantsʼ
‘new arrivalsʼ.
These words donʼt say anything about a personʼs culture or language: they are neutral. Donʼt
use these words once people have settled and become Australian citizens. They suggest a
temporary or marginal status.
Use the terms ‘given nameʼ and ‘family
nameʼ
Many naming systems around the world differ from those used in English-speaking
countries.
Given names come before family names in English-speaking countries. In some Asian
cultures, people write the family name first.
This is not always obvious when the names are unfamiliar. Sometimes, the owners of names
foresee the possible confusion for English speakers. They reverse the order in an English-
speaking context.
When you ask people their name, donʼt ask for ‘Christian nameʼ, ‘first nameʼ, ‘forenameʼ or
‘surnameʼ. These terms all take for granted the European conventions and order of names.
Instead, ask for their:Example

family name.
Some people state a preferred name instead of their given name. This could be different
from their legal name, so be clear about which you need.
Other countries have variations of name order. For example:
In Indonesia, some people have only one name. They might use this in Australia for both
their given name and family name to conform with Western conventions.
In Myanmar, names are not divided into given and family names. These names keep
their full form instead.

Gender and sexual diversity
Gender and sexual diversity
Inclusive language conveys gender equality and is gender neutral. Respect
peopleʼs gender and sexual identity with pronoun choice, job titles and personal
titles.
Use gender-neutral language
Use terms that recognise gender equality. Avoid terms that discriminate on the basis of a
personʼs gender or sexual identity.
Our use of language reflects changes in society. There is wide agreement about using
language to support equality between all genders.
Inclusivity requirements
It is unlawful to discriminate against a person under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984
(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02868). This discrimination relates to
their:
sex
marital or relationship status
actual or potential pregnancy
sexual orientation
gender identity
intersex status.07/09/2024, 13:27 Gender and sexual diversity | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/inclusive-language/gender-and-sexual-diversity 1/7It is also unlawful to discriminate against a person because they are breastfeeding.
Pronoun choice
Learn the userʼs pronoun (/node/131). If itʼs not clear and you canʼt ask them, choose
gender-neutral pronouns.
The singular ‘theyʼ is gender-neutral. It avoids specifying a personʼs gender.
You can use ‘theyʼ or ‘themʼ when you would otherwise use a singular personal pronoun such
as:
‘heʼ
‘sheʼ
‘himʼ
‘herʼ.
You can also use ‘themselvesʼ or ‘themselfʼ instead of ‘himselfʼ or ‘herselfʼ. ‘Themselfʼ is an
extension of using ‘theyʼ for a single person.
The use of gender-neutral pronouns to refer to a person of unknown gender has a long
history. Usage now covers people who either:
donʼt wish to identify as a particular gender
identify as non-binary or gender-fluid.
There are many ways to avoid using gender-specific pronouns.
Example
You must provide copies of the application to your referees. [Use the second-person
pronouns (‘youʼ and ‘yourʼ) with direct tone and active voice.]
Candidates must provide copies of the application to their referees. [Use a plural
pronoun. The pronoun ‘theirʼ relates to a plural subject ‘candidatesʼ.]
Every candidate must provide copies of the application to referees. [Leave the pronoun
out altogether.]07/09/2024, 13:27 Gender and sexual diversity | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/inclusive-language/gender-and-sexual-diversity 2/7Avoid gender-specific job titles
Avoid using job titles that end in ‘-manʼ or ‘-womanʼ.
Avoid using the traditional terms for jobs that end in ‘-manʼ.
You should also avoid job terms that specify women.Write this

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/inclusive-language/gender-and-sexual-diversity 3/7Gender is not relevant to a personʼs profession or title in general. Use gender-specific
adjectives only when gender is relevant. For example, an economic analysis might discuss
‘female-dominatedʼ or ‘male-dominatedʼ industries.
Titles ‘Msʼ and ‘Mxʼ
‘Msʼ is now widely used instead of ‘Mrsʼ or ‘Missʼ. It does not disclose marital status.
‘Mxʼ refers to non-binary people and those who do not wish to be referred to by their gender.
Use ‘Mxʼ when a person indicates this is what they prefer, but not otherwise.
Forms and surveys can ask for people to specify gender. Donʼt ask for a title or gender
identity unless the form is designed to collect this information (/node/177). For example, a
form can ask for a personʼs given and family name (/node/59). It does not need to ask for
their preferred title.
Check for changes in language use
Take care in areas where language is changing. Follow the rule that people have the right to
identify their sexual orientation and gender identity as they choose.
The discussion is still evolving about words for other aspects of gender and sexual diversity.
Gender and sexual diversity terms
It can help to know the meanings of words people use about gender and sexual diversity.
This includes sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics.
‘Genderʼ is about social and cultural differences and identity. ‘Genderʼ and ‘sexʼ both
mean ‘the state of being male or femaleʼ but are often used in different ways.
‘Gender expressionʼ is the way a person expresses their gender.
‘Gender identityʼ is about who a person feels themself to be. It refers to the way a
person identifies or expresses their masculine or feminine traits.
‘Gender-queerʼ and ‘non-binaryʼ refer to people who donʼt identify as either male or
female. They may identify as both or neither. ‘Gender-fluidʼ refers to people who do notwaitress

‘Intersexʼ refers to people with innate genetic, hormonal or physical sex characteristics
that do not conform to medical norms for female or male bodies.
‘Sexʼ refers to the legal status that was initially determined by sex characteristics
observed at birth.
‘Sex characteristicsʼ are a personʼs physical sex features, such as their chromosomes,
hormones and reproductive organs.
‘Sexual orientationʼ is a personʼs romantic or sexual attraction to another person, such
as heterosexual, gay, lesbian or bisexual.
‘Sexualityʼ includes biological sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy and
reproduction.
‘Transgenderʼ means people whose gender identity is different from that given to them
at birth.
These are not the only ways to use these words. The definitions highlight some of the main
points and distinctions. For more advice on these terms, go to:

LGBTI and LGBTIQ+ communities
The term LGBT arose in the 1990s to refer to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.
The term has since expanded to LGBTI, to include intersex people. LGBTI is now widely
accepted and used.
Recently, the term has expanded again to LGBTIQ, LGBTIQ+ or LGBTIQA+. The ‘Qʼ refers to
the queer community or to people questioning their gender identity. The ‘Aʼ refers to asexual
people. The newer terms are used less frequently. The use of ‘+ʼ represents other sexual
identities.
Australian Government agencies use both LGBTI and LGBTIQ+.
‘SOGIESCʼ is a term writers use when discussing law and policy. It refers to ‘sexual
orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristicsʼ. This term replaces the
earlier term ‘SOGIIʼ. It referred to ‘sexual orientation, gender identity and intersexʼ issues.07/09/2024, 13:27 Gender and sexual diversity | Style Manual

People with disability
Disability does not define people. Use inclusive language that respects
diversity.
Focus on the person, not the disability
Mention disability only when itʼs relevant to the content.
When you are writing about people with disability, focus on the person. Engage with people
through user research (https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/build-and-improve-
services/user-research).
User research can uncover whether an individual or community preference is:
person-first language
identity-first language.
Use person-first language for Australian Government content, unless user research says
otherwise.

around language that respects individual or community preferences.
Accessibility and inclusivity requirements
You must design accessible content to meet the Digital Service Standard:
Criterion 1. Understand user needs (https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-
advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/1-understand-
user-needs)
Criterion 9. Make it accessible (https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-
service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/9-make-it-accessible)
You must make all government content accessible to people with disability. 
Use respectful and inclusive language that talks to the person – not their difference.
Commonwealth laws include:
Disability Discrimination Act 1992
(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A04426)
Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986
(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A03366)
Use respectful language
Respectful language acknowledges peoplesʼ preferences to identify with a particular
community or characteristic. 
Terms should not identify people without an understanding of personal preference. For
example, many people who are deaf or hard of hearing may identify as ‘Deafʼ – a cultural
group with a different first language. 
Avoid using the disability as an adjective that defines the person, unless that is their
preference. Use the word ‘disabilityʼ as an uncountable noun (/node/122).
Use person-first language when you donʼt understand individual or community
preferences. Describe the person and then the characteristic.07/09/2024, 13:27 People with disability | Style Manual

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/inclusive-language/people-disability 3/10You can cause offence when you do not use respectful language, even if it is well
intentioned.
Donʼt say a person is inspirational only because of their disability.
Donʼt write about people as if they are heroes or victims.
Avoid euphemisms and made-up terms, such as ‘differently abledʼ and ‘handicapableʼ.
People with disability could consider these types of terms condescending.  
When you are making comparisons, write:
‘person without disabilityʼ – rather than ‘able-bodiedʼ
‘sighted personʼ for someone who is not blind
‘hearing personʼ for someone who is not deaf
‘neurotypicalʼ for someone who is not autistic.
The social model of disability
The traditional view of disability has been a medical model. In this approach, disability is a
health condition for health professionals to treat, fix or cure. 
Many people with disability prefer another approach: the social model of disability. This is a
way to understand how people with disability interact with their environment and others in
society.
The social model is about shifting the problem from individual impairments to the social
environment that people operate in.
From this viewpoint, disability arises from the way people with disability interact with the
world. They encounter physical barriers, digital barriers and barriers of attitudes and
communication. These block their participation in society.
The social model recognises the reality of a disability and its effects. By contrast, the
medical model looks at impairments that create a medical condition.deaf person

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/inclusive-language/people-disability 4/10The Australian Federation of Disability Organisations has more information on the social
model of disability (https://www.afdo.org.au/social-model-of-disability/).
Advocates of the social model of disability focus on the barriers to participating in society
faced by people living with disability.
People who are blind or have low vision
‘Legal blindnessʼ and being ‘legally blindʼ have specific definitions. In government use, these
terms relate a person's sight loss to eligibility criteria. Many people who are legally blind do
have some vision. 
The terms ‘blindʼ and ‘low visionʼ include people with no sight and people who have some
sight.
A person who is totally blind does not perceive light and has no usable vision. A person who
has low vision has some ability to see. Wearing regular glasses will not improve their vision.
A person who is blind or who has low vision might use screen reading software, Braille
displays, or screen magnification technology to access content. People who are blind might
use other ways to communicate using hearing or touch.
Acceptable terms include ‘person who is blindʼ and ‘person who has low visionʼ. Donʼt write
‘the blindʼ or ‘person without sightʼ.
People who are deaf or hard of hearing
The terms ‘deafʼ and ‘hard of hearingʼ include people with no hearing or limited hearing.
They might have difficulty using audio content. If you are providing audio content, make the
information available in other ways – such as captions and a transcript.
The World Federation of the Deaf disapproves of the term ‘hearing impairedʼ as it describes
people as if they have a deficiency.
Refer to someone with hearing loss as a ‘person who is deaf or hard of hearingʼ.
Some people who are deaf or hard of hearing use the Australian sign language, Auslan.
Some people who are deaf or hard of hearing view themselves as members of a community
and language group. This community calls itself the Deaf community, and encourages others
to do the same. The Deaf community uses the term with a capital letter ‘Dʼ as a mark of its
identity.07/09/2024, 13:27 People with disability | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/inclusive-language/people-disability 5/10Members of the Deaf community might still use deaf with a lowercase ‘dʼ to refer to their
hearing.
People with cognitive disability
People with cognitive disability include people with intellectual disability, acquired brain
injury or dementia.
‘Cognitive disabilityʼ is a broad term that covers a range of conditions. Genes, illnesses,
injury, physical factors or environmental factors may cause cognitive disability.
Creating content in more than one format, such as making an Easy Read version, can help
some people with cognitive disability access information. Follow W3C updates on making
content usable for people with cognitive and learning disabilities
(https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/).
People with learning disability
People with ‘learning disabilityʼ might have difficulty planning and difficulty processing new
information. The causes are neurological. They are difficult to address and can be lifelong.
Some Australian support groups and educators use ‘learning difficultyʼ and ‘learning
disabilityʼ for all people who have difficulty learning a basic academic skill. 
Learning disability is not the same as a learning difficulty, which can be overcome with
intensive teaching or training. Learning difficulties are not generally considered to be
disability.
Examples of learning disabilities are dyslexia (reading), dyscalculia (mathematics) and
various auditory processing disorders (sound and verbal instructions). Having a learning
disability is not related to intelligence.
People with mental illness
‘Mental illnessʼ is a broad term that covers many different conditions that influence the way
people act, think, feel or see the world.
The term ‘psychosocial disabilityʼ is specific to some people with severe mental health
conditions. It covers both psychological and social factors. It focuses on restrictions on
participating in society. Not every mental illness involves a psychosocial disability.
Some ways of talking about mental illness can cause offence.07/09/2024, 13:27 People with disability | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/inclusive-language/people-disability 6/10Use people-first language when you refer to a person with mental illness.
Describe the person as ‘havingʼ mental illness, just as you would for any other illness or
injury. Donʼt describe the person as ‘beingʼ a disease.
Mental illness sometimes attracts social stigma. This stigma may prevent people from
acknowledging their mental health conditions and talking about them with others.
There is advice about the best language to use for mental illness in guides from the
Australian Human Rights Commission (https://www.humanrights.gov.au/our-work/appendix-
c-how-talk-about-mental-illness) and Everymind (https://everymind.org.au/understanding-
mental-health/mental-health/language-and-stigma).Write this

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/accessible-and-inclusive-content/inclusive-language/people-disability 7/10Neurodiversity
The term ‘neurodiversityʼ refers to the idea that neurological differences, such as autism and
ADHD, sit within the normal spectrum of human variation. Neurological differences are not
always a disability. Advocates refer to the diverse range of differences in the brain and
behaviour. They say societal barriers are the main factors disabling people.
Neurodiversity was first used for people on the autism spectrum. It is now also applied to
other conditions, such as dyslexia.

User research and content
User research and content
Only create content that meets a need. Find out about users and their needs
through user research.
Create content that meets a real need
Only design and write content that meets a real personʼs need. 
People using government services usually donʼt have a choice to go somewhere else to meet
their need. They donʼt read government content for fun. They are using it to get something
done.
Find out about users and their needs through user research (https://www.dta.gov.au/help-
and-advice/build-and-improve-services/user-research).
User research helps you:
understand the user, their needs, behaviours and motivations
work out the problems you are trying to solve with content
reduce the risk of creating content that is not useful or usable
have more certainty about what to write.
Digital Service Standard requirements
You must understand the needs of the users of your service to meet the Digital
Service Standard: Criterion 1. Understand user needs (https://www.dta.gov.au/help-
and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/1-understand-07/09/2024, 13:27 User research and content | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/user-research-and-content 1/9user-needs).
Write for the user, not ‘an audienceʼ
Writing for an audience is not the same as writing for the user.
The content we write might have more than one user with a range of different needs.
Itʼs not enough to imagine one kind of user. You need to do user research to learn about the
range of users and their contexts. It's important to find out about their specific and diverse
needs.
A userʼs needs and context may include:
a primary language that is something other than English
assistive technology they use to read the content
a range of devices they use to access the content with
the availability and speed of their internet access
a need for a paper or non-digital way to access content.
Accessibility considerations
Do user research to help you to understand how to meet the needs of all users.
Include people with disability in your user research to avoid creating any barriers for
them.
Adjust the research approach to the
context
The way you research changes based on the kind of work you are doing and its context.
If you can, work with a user researcher to plan the approach.07/09/2024, 13:27 User research and content | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/user-research-and-content 2/9Policy or project work
In a policy or project context, you may be writing material that is only intended for an internal
use. Only a few people might read it.
In this context you may not need to do research with the people who will read the content.
You might need to find out about the subject of the content you are working on.
If you are writing about other people, make sure you are not making assumptions about
them. This includes other people working in government as well as end users.
Service design and delivery
User research is critical to the service design and delivery process. In this process, everyone
in the team takes part in research through the Discovery, Alpha, Beta and Live stages.
From Discovery and into Alpha stage, the research is generative. Itʼs about gaining insights
about users, contexts and needs – usually through face-to-face interviews.
When the team moves into Beta, the research becomes evaluative. Itʼs about testing that the
content and the design is meeting the userʼs needs.
Read the DTAʼs digital guides to find out about the role of user research in service design
(https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/build-and-improve-services/user-research).Example
You are a policy officer working on a short progress report for a senior manager. The
report updates the manager on a government policy your team is developing.
As you write the report you check for assumptions about the people the policy will
affect. You identify some untested assumptions so you raise this with the team for more
research.
Example
You are a content designer working on a government service. Your team follows the
service design and delivery process.
Discovery stage: you observe research sessions with users and help to analyse
them. The user researcher plans and leads the sessions to help the team learn
about the users and their needs.07/09/2024, 13:27 User research and content | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/user-research-and-content 3/9Communication and website teams
Teams that work on content owned by other areas of the organisation use research in
different ways.
In some cases, the communications or web team may be able to lead the work and follow the
service design and delivery process. In other cases, they may organise user research to
support the business area.Alpha stage: you help the team experiment with different content formats. You join
research sessions to see if the prototypes help meet the user needs.
Beta stage: you work with the team to design content for the whole service. You
observe people in usability sessions interact with the content you have designed.
After analysing the research as a team, you improve the content.
Live stage: you and the team spend time each sprint reviewing user feedback and
analytics. If there are areas that need more exploration, the researcher plans
targeted research.
Example
You are a writer and editor working in a corporate communications team. Your team
supports several business areas that own most of the content on the website.
The teamʼs approach to research changes based on where content is in a content
lifecycle (https://www.digitalprofession.gov.au/content-strategy-guide/manage-content-
requests):
Intent: as a team you audit website content to identify what is and is not used.
Plan: you join members of another team in watching user research sessions. The
team observes users interacting with their content, to identify pain points. People
from both teams take part in a session to analyse the research.
Create, check and revise: you observe readability tests of your content with end
users. You edit the content in response to the user experience.
Maintain: you watch usability testing of content on your agencyʼs website. You
observe users having trouble understanding a form. Following the session, you
work with the business area that owns the form to improve it.
Remove: you help review analytics and user feedback to flag pages that have low
traffic. You provide a report to the business area to recommend removing the
pages.07/09/2024, 13:27 User research and content | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/user-research-and-content 4/9User research is a team sport
If you are creating content you need to be part of the user research process.
It is best if you can observe research sessions led by an experienced user researcher. Then
help to synthesise and analyse the research.
In a team that is delivering a service, everyone is part of research for at least 2 hours every 6
weeks. This include writers, content designers and editors.
People who work on content must be part of the discovery process. They need to observe
research sessions and contribute their perspective in analysis. Content designers, writers
and editors notice things that other people may miss. They provide a critical content lens on
the work.
Some research is better than none
User research is a craft. If possible, get an expert to lead research. This will help you uncover
as much as possible and manage bias.
If you or your team are not able to access a user researcher or to talk to users, at least do
desktop research.
Desktop research
Desktop research includes looking at website analytics to identify search keywords and
topics. It also involves exploring forums and social media to find out the questions people are
asking and the words they use.
When you look at search data be aware that people use different words to search for and to
talk about things. Search terms can also be different based on the forum and site they are
using.
Desktop research will not provide the same quality of insight as you get from talking to
users. It is better to do this than no research at all.
Itʼs also helpful to do desktop research as well as interviewing users.07/09/2024, 13:27 User research and content | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/user-research-and-content 5/9Previous research
Review existing relevant research as part of your desktop research. This includes research
by other teams and academic research from outside government.
When you review existing research, be aware that the context will be different. There may
also be gaps in the research.
Use existing research as a starting point. Itʼs not helpful to research the same thing over and
over.
Market research is different from user
research
User research helps you understand users, their needs and the context for services.
Market research and stakeholder engagement are different types of research. They cannot
give you the same insights you get from user research.
If you have a choice, do user research. It can be helpful to do market research and
stakeholder management as well.
User research: know the user
User research:
uses qualitative research (feedback) and quantitative research (statistics)
focuses on the ‘whyʼ (including peopleʼs underlying needs, motivations and the goals
they are trying to achieve) and the 'whatʼ (what people actually do), as well as
the usability of what is being designed
provides deep insights into user needs and behaviour
uses small-scale and often iterative techniques (for example, interviews, feedback,
usability testing, sample-size testing, field studies and workshops)
aims to understand user needs and fix usability problems
helps to design content and services that are accessible and usable for all users07/09/2024, 13:27 User research and content | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/user-research-and-content 6/9Market research: know the market
Market research:
uses quantitative research (statistics)
focuses on the ‘whatʼ
provides broad information
uses wide-scale techniques (for example, focus groups, randomised control trials,
surveys, analytics, and website split testing)
aims to understand market preferences and how to reach that market
helps to measure characteristics across the population to build market share in a
particular segment
Stakeholder engagement: know the community
Stakeholder engagement: 
focuses on the ‘whoʼ and the ‘howʼ
provides insights that support issues management
uses techniques that are contextualised to the scale and complexity of the issues
aims to manage the influence of people and groups
helps the design of processes to deliver an outcome

Types of editing (levels)
There are different levels of editing. Each involves specific tasks that happen at certain
stages in content development. The aim in any level of edit is to meet user needs and make
sure content is fit for purpose.
Substantive editing focuses on content, style,
structure and meaning
The substantive edit reviews structural and textual elements when the draft content is
complete.
Substantive editing shapes text to make meaning clear. It also improves the structure,
usability, language and presentation of thecontent. It is sometimes called a structural edit.
Before starting, agree on the scope of the substantive edit in the team.
The substantive edit can:
conduct a plain English review to check sentence length, replace complex words with
simpler alternatives and remove jargon
check the design of the content to make sure it is the best possible format
reorganise content to improve the flow of information and navigation
identify gaps in the content or any information that can be removed07/09/2024, 13:28 Editing and proofreading | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/editing-and-proofreading 4/10reword content to make it easier to understand and to achieve consistent voice and
tone
check compliance with specific government requirements.
The style sheet is updated through a substantive edit to record any decisions that can inform
a copyedit.
Substantive editing is not rewriting or fact-checking
Substantive editing does not:
write a significant amount of new content (but it can include advice to add more
content)
substantially rewrite to shorten text (but it can involve advice to delete content)
choose the right typeface or apply formatting styles (but can include checking bolded,
italicised and underlined font)
fact-check, such as checking names of people and places, dates, citations, quotes or
links to external content.
An editor can rewrite or fact-check content, but these are separate tasks to substantive
editing. They should happen before any editing begins.
Copyediting focuses on consistency and accuracy
Copyediting happens once the content is settled, for example, after the substantive edit. A
copyedit shows whether content is consistent, accurate and complete.
Before starting, agree on the scope of the copyedit within the team. An editor might identify
substantive issues with the content during the copyedit. The team should decide how it will
address those issues.
If there is any more substantive editing or rewriting after the copyedit, the content will need
to be copyedited again.
During copyediting, an editor:
corrects issues with language in line with the style sheet
aligns the style of references and citations with agreed referencing style
comments on inconsistencies in voice and tone.
A copyedit also checks for issues or inconsistencies with:07/09/2024, 13:28 Editing and proofreading | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/editing-and-proofreading 5/10design, layout and function
illustrations, tables, headings, sequences, internal links and other elements.
The style sheet is updated during a copyedit to record style decisions.
Copyediting is not substantive editing or rewriting
Copyediting does not:
restructure content (other than to make sentences clear and grammatically correct)
write new content or shorten text
rewrite text to unify voice or edit for plain English (other than to deal with isolated
issues)
format or design text
fact-check
check external links embedded in the content (other than a spot check in case there are
systemic issues).
Proofreading is about quality control
Proofreading is a quality-assurance process. It happens after the copyedit. It is a final check
on visual and textual elements.
A proofread confirms that the content:
is correct
is complete
meets the organisationʼs requirements to publish.
Proofreading gives assurance:
the content is ready to ‘go liveʼ
the printing press can start running.
Proofreading compares the content that is about to go live or to print with a master copy.
The master copy is the current copy of the approved text.
The master copy should be error-free so the proofreader can check for any introduced
errors.07/09/2024, 13:28 Editing and proofreading | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/editing-and-proofreading 6/10A proofread compares the master copy with:
the publishing platform
the design proof from the designer
a printerʼs proof from the printer.
The proofread makes sure nothing gets changed or missed in any of these steps.
The style sheet is a critical tool for this task, even though proofreading is not editing. (What
many people call ‘proofreadingʼ is what editors call ‘copyeditingʼ.) The style sheet ensures
proofreadersʼ work follows earlier style decisions.
Proofreaders do not make changes to content. Proofreaders query issues such as:
content that is different to the master copy, including changes, introduced errors and
missing content
missing or incorrectly placed elements such as links, page numbers, table headings and
captions
design elements like typefaces, heading styles and hierarchies, page breaks and
spacing
obvious errors in spelling or grammar, checked against the style sheet
anything that goes against the decisions in the style sheet.
The proofreaderʼs queries go to whoever is responsible for resolving particular issues.
There can be several rounds of proofreading until no errors remain. Each time proofing
corrections are made, the proofreader should check the content again. Each check ensures
there are no flow-on errors to the text, layout or design.
‘Blind proofreadingʼ is when there is no master copy. This requires an experienced
proofreader, because there is no authorised version to compare against.
Proofreading is not editing
Proofreading is not editing and it is not a substitute for copyediting.
Proofreading does not include checking:
for inconsistent language, spelling or grammar
non-textual elements, such as the content of tables or illustrations.07/09/2024, 13:28 Editing and proofreading | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/editing-and-proofreading 7/10Proofreaders notice issues and query them. Proofreading is not a chance to have another
round of editing, add more content, or add new functions to content.
Proofreading is better with 2 people
Proofreaders are most effective when working in teams of 2. The team is:
a copyholder, who reads aloud from the master copy
a reader, who checks the final version for changes and errors and marks up the content.
This approach is especially helpful when checking complex, data-rich content, such as:
mathematical or scientific content
annual reports
long financial tables.
A style sheet is a useful tool
The style sheet is a living record and a tool for communicating decisions in the content team.
It helps to ensure quality and consistency.
A style sheet includes decisions about:
the dictionary you follow
any spelling variations
any variations you are making from this manual or your organisationʼs style guide.
It can also include any style decisions informed by user research on user needs and
accessibility.
An editor adds to the style sheet as they edit, including elements such as:
spelling
capitalisation
grammar
punctuation.
The updates ensure the style sheet records all decisions. Updates remove the need to
repeat the decision-making process on any aspect of the content.07/09/2024, 13:28 Editing and proofreading | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/editing-and-proofreading 8/10Keeping a style sheet up to date means all team members can use the same style, making
the content as consistent as possible.
Australian standards set out specialist
skills and know-how
The Institute of Professional Editors (IPEd), in consultation with all Australian editing
societies, has developed the IPEd (https://www.iped-editors.org/about-editing/australian-
standards/)standards for editing practice (https://www.iped-editors.org/about-
editing/australian-standards/). This resource sets out the corestandards that professional
editors should meet. It is the foundation for IPEdʼs national accreditation scheme
(https://www.iped-editors.org/accreditation-scheme/).

Security classifications and protective markings
Security classifications and
protective markings
Use protective markings for government information. Follow your organisationʼs
procedures to add them.
Add protective markings to government
information
If you are working with government information, follow organisational procedures to assess
and apply protective markings to sensitive and classified information.
The protective marking will usually be in all capitals at the top and bottom of a page.
Information is assessed and given protective marking to identify if it is sensitive or security
classified.
Information might be identified as ‘Unofficialʼ, ‘Officialʼ or ‘Official: Sensitiveʼ.
Information might be security classified as ‘Protectedʼ, ‘Secretʼ or ‘Top Secretʼ.
Other protective markings include caveats (such as codewords and special handling
instructions) and information management markers. Caveat markings are mandatory
and information management markers are optional.
All sensitive and security classified information, including emails, carry protective markings.
Information metadata is also marked.07/09/2024, 13:28 Security classiﬁcations and protective markings | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/security-classiﬁcations-and-protective-markings 1/4Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) requirements include how the information is
classified and marked, and what this means for its storage, handling, access and disposal.
For more information, consult the PSPF webpages
(https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/policies/information-security). Or consult your
organisationʼs protective security policy.
Security classification requirements
The Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) explains how protective markings
should be formatted (https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/publications-
library/policy-8-classification-system). To achieve clearly identifiable protective
markings, the PSPF recommends:
using capitals, bold text, large font and a distinctive colour (red preferred)
placing markings at the centre top and bottom of each page
separating markings by a double forward slash to help clearly differentiate each
marking.
When you write for the Australian Government, be aware of PSPF requirements for
government information (https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/policies/information-
security). Follow organisational procedures to apply security classifications and
protective markings to content before referring to the PSPF.
Agency implementation of the PSPF is supported by the Department of Home Affairs
(https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/).
Use initial capitals to write about
protective markings
In general content, use an initial capital unless you are reporting how the protective marking
actually appears on the page. In that instance, write the marking as it appears and use
quotation marks.
Example
Only those with an existing Negative Vetting 1 security clearance are considered for
supervised temporary access to Top Secret information.07/09/2024, 13:28 Security classiﬁcations and protective markings | Style Manual

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/clear-language-and-writing-style/plain-language-and-word-choice 7/11For names and terms with special meaning, follow style rules and conventions (/node/117).
This helps users scan content.
Be selective about shortened forms, such as abbreviations (/node/184), contractions
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-
and-phrases/contractions), acronyms and initialisms (/node/190).
Some shortened forms are better-known than the full form of the term, for example ‘DNAʼ.
Check a dictionary to see if the acronym or initialism is listed.
Shorten only the words and phrases that are well known or used many times in your content.
Shortened forms can help people read and understand content, but too many can be difficult
to keep track of.
Spell them out the first time you use them.
Shortened forms can be a type of jargon that is not suitable in plain language content. Try to
avoid them altogether if they are used only once or twice.
You can include technical or specialist terms if your research shows your audience uses
them. But start with plain language words as the default to keep the reading level accessible.
Plain language helps everyone (/node/62#simple_content_helps_all_users).
To help people understand specialist or technical content:
explain terms – for example, use a glossary
include a short summary without using specialist terms.
In content with many specialist terms, reserve shortened forms for the most frequently used
terms only. Spell out other terms in full.

Sentences
Sentences
Clear sentences in active voice improve readability. Keep sentences short to
help people scan content.
Write plain language sentences
Standard English sentences are built on subject–verb–object order
(/node/120#a_full_sentence_is_grammatically_complete). This structure forms the basis of
plain language writing.
Keep sentences to an average of 15 words and no more than 25 words, especially for digital
content. Too many words, phrases and clauses affect peopleʼs ability to scan sentences
(/node/60#complex_sentences_are_hard_to_read).
Sometimes itʼs hard to avoid longer sentences – for example, if you have to include a long
department name. Sentences over 25 words can usually be broken up using different
techniques, like using lists (/node/56).
Accessibility requirements
User need:
I can read and understand text, even if the content includes unusual words and
shortened forms, and features languages other than English.
Fundamentals:07/09/2024, 13:28 Sentences | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/clear-language-and-writing-style/sentences 1/12Write in plain language. This helps all users and is essential for some.
Avoid (or explain) unusual words, phrases, idioms and so on. Expand all
acronyms on their first use.
Avoid using double negatives.
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criterion:
3.1.5 Reading level – level AAA (https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#reading-
level). Level AAA requires a lower secondary education reading level, after removal of
proper names and titles (year 7 or between 12 and 14 years old (/node/62)).
Use active voice
Use active rather than passive voice
(/node/120#passive_voice_changes_standard_sentence_order). Active voice helps users
understand who is doing what. It can also help people know exactly what their responsibility
is.
The difference is clearest with action verbs
(/node/128#verbs_describe_an_action_a_state_an_event_or_a_change):
Active voice: the grammatical subject is performing the action in a sentence.
Passive voice: the grammatical subject is undergoing the action.Example
Eligible students can access the subsidy by completing the application. [Active voice]
The subsidy can be accessed by completing the application. [Passive voice]
Example
Active voice: The student filed the application. [‘The studentʼ is the grammatical subject,
who did the filing. ‘The applicationʼ is the object.]
Passive voice: The application was filed by the student. [‘The applicationʼ is the
grammatical subject, but did not do the filing.]07/09/2024, 13:28 Sentences | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/clear-language-and-writing-style/sentences 2/12Construct positive, unambiguous
sentences
Words, phrases and sentences can have more than one meaning. Write exactly what you
mean and construct your sentences so there is no ambiguity.
Write sentences so they are positive rather than negative.
Avoid double negatives
Double negatives can lead to misunderstandings, so avoid them.Like this
The graduate with a broken leg sat at the desk. [The graduate has a broken leg.]
Not this
The graduate sat at the desk with a broken leg. [Either the graduate or the desk could
have a broken leg.]

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/clear-language-and-writing-style/sentences 3/12Eliminate unnecessary words
Make each word work for its place in the sentence. Sentence structure is clearer if each word
plays a necessary role. Clear sentences improve readability.
It helps to test the combination to know which words are necessary.
Keep the words that play a critical function in the sentence. Remove all the words except the
subject, verb and object (if applicable)
(/node/120#a_full_sentence_is_grammatically_complete).
Check if the sentence is grammatically correct when you remove the other words.
Build the sentence back together, leaving out any words that arenʼt absolutely
necessary. Adverbs and adjectives are usually good candidates to leave out in this kind of
test.
Check if the basic meaning of the sentence remains, and if itʼs grammatical. Then check if
the words youʼve removed are really working to keep their place.
Testing combinations as you write will also help create concise and easily understood
headings, fragment lists and descriptive links.Write this
We provide statistics for trade reports. Contact us with trade data requests and weʼll
respond within 2 business days.
[This is concise text that communicates relevant and necessary information. It uses 19
words.]
Not this
Our team will happily provide you with any statistics you might be seeking for the
purpose of producing better and more factually accurate trade reports. Let us know if
youʼre seeking specific trade data and weʼll seek to provide it to you as soon as we can,
usually within 2 business days.
[This text uses unnecessary adverbs, adjectives and contains irrelevant information. It
uses 52 words.]07/09/2024, 13:28 Sentences | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/clear-language-and-writing-style/sentences 4/12Word combinations affect punctuation, spelling, capitalisation and formatting. For example,
there are rules about the use of commas between adjectives
(/node/126#there_is_a_common_order_for_strings_of_adjectives) and the use of hyphens
between adverbs and verbs
(/node/105#dont_hyphenate_ing_and_ed_verbs_or_most_ly_adverbs).
Check guidance about types of words and their function (/node/203). This guidance relates
closely to other style rules in grammar, punctuation and conventions (/grammar-
punctuation-and-conventions).
Be precise
Avoid unnecessary words. Keep the words needed to make meaning clear.
Avoid using ‘there isʼ and ‘there areʼ when they only add extra words and not meaning.
Vary sentence structure
Vary your sentence structure to suit the content.Like this
Call us if you have any questions.
Not this
If you were unsure about any of the information or needed more details, you are
welcome to telephone our office to acquire what you needed.
Write this

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/clear-language-and-writing-style/sentences 5/12Sentence structures can be simple, compound or complex
(/node/120#sentences_are_simple_compound_or_complex). This depends on the number of
clauses they contain and how clauses work together (/node/143).
Simple sentence structures are easier to scan. People understand meaning through the
order of words in a sentence. A simple sentence construction has fewer parts to take in.
Compound and complex sentences can add variety and flow to your writing. Sentences
should still be easy to scan, even using these structures.
Complex structure is harder to follow, regardless of a personʼs literacy level. Complex
structures take more effort to read, even if they are punctuated properly.
Build simple phrases and clauses
Sentences consist of phrases (/node/144) and clauses (/node/143). Each group of words
carries out a different function.
Phrases and clauses are groups of words that work as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs or
prepositions in sentences.
You can build layers of meaning by combining different types of words, phrases and clauses.
Layering sentences makes them more complex.Like this
You can delete your application within an hour of applying.
[‘Within an hour of applyingʼ modifies the main clause.]
Not this
You can, within an hour of applying, delete your application.
[The modifier is inserted into the main clause. This structure is complex and slows down
reading.]
Example
The plane arrived.07/09/2024, 13:28 Sentences | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/clear-language-and-writing-style/sentences 6/12Some common constructions used in bureaucratic writing are complex and unnecessary.
They add words but not meaning.
Instead of bureaucratic language, use plain language words and terms (/node/55).
For example, use a verb instead of the noun that relates to the verb. If you use the noun
instead, you have to change the verb into the noun and usually add other words.
Use fewer than 3 adjectives or nouns at a time
Phrases that combine more than 3 adjectives or nouns are difficult to understand. Rephrase
sentences to break up strings of adjectives or noun trains
(/node/122#noun_trains_are_hard_to_understand).
You can often rephrase the string of adjectives or noun train as a clause (/node/143). Follow
the rule to keep sentences short and their structure simple.The plane arrived in Darwin.
The plane arrived in Darwin carrying freight.
The plane arrived in Darwin carrying freight that needs inspection.
The plane arrived in Darwin carrying freight that needs inspection for dangerous goods.
The plane arrived in Darwin carrying freight that – before being unloaded – needs
inspection for dangerous goods.

Donʼt use words such as ‘ifʼ and ‘unlessʼ in the same sentence.
Use ‘other thanʼ carefully
When you use ‘other thanʼ, make sure itʼs clear which words are included in the exception.
Avoid ‘such ... asʼ and ‘beingʼ

Voice and tone
Voice and tone
Writing style is a result of voice and tone. Adjust your style to meet user needs.
It influences whether and how people engage with content.
Adapt writing style with tone and voice
Writing style describes the way you express ideas in content. The tone and voice you
use influence the writing style for any type of content.
Tone is the way you express ideas. It includes the words you use, the way you put them
together and their level of formality.
Voice captures who is writing – a persona people understand when they engage with the
content. Voice can be objective and institutional or personal and friendly.Example
By registering with us, you can access a range of member services online. [Standard
tone]
Online services are only available to members who have registered. [Formal tone]
Example
Over the next 3 years, the department will bolster its investment in cyber security.
[Institutional voice, standard tone]07/09/2024, 13:28 Voice and tone | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/clear-language-and-writing-style/voice-and-tone 1/8Adapt tone and voice to engage users, so the content can meet their needs. For example,
briefs for ministers will use a different tone and voice to a speech or information on a
website.
Align tone to context
Tone is created by 4 elements:
choice of words
viewpoint
grammar
level of formality.
Word choice
Word choice will influence how users respond to you and your organisation. The smallest
details, such as using contractions, can affect how content comes across.
Viewpoint
The way the user relates to the content can depend on what pronouns feature in sentence
structure.
The second person (using the pronoun ‘youʼ) is active, direct and personal. It can be more
engaging for people reading and using government content.
Using the first person singular (the pronoun ‘Iʼ) is rarely suitable in government content,
except in correspondence.
Grammar
Grammar is about sentence structure (/node/120). It affects the way your writing sounds and
how easy it is to read.Our investment in workforce capability will create an ‘army of cyber expertsʼ. [Personal
voice, standard tone]07/09/2024, 13:28 Voice and tone | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/clear-language-and-writing-style/voice-and-tone 2/8Formality
Formality is about how closely you follow standard English and how familiar the tone
of content needs to be.
Choose how formal tone should be
The appropriate level of formality depends on what the relationship is between content and
its user. There are 3 levels of formality:
formal
standard
informal.
A formal tone creates a distance between the contentʼs persona and the contentʼs reader.
An informal tone suggests a relationship that is more casual and intimate.
A standard tone sits between these 2. It is appropriate for most government content. It
creates little distance, but not too much familiarity, into the relationship with readers.
Standard style is the easiest for many people to understand.
Formality does not affect plain language (/node/55).
Formal tone
Formal tone:Example
Guests should be seated 15 minutes before the performance starts. [Formal]
Why donʼt you come in early and grab a seat before things get started? [Informal]
Example

is literal – words are used with their dictionary meaning
doesnʼt use metaphor, slang or idioms
often uses the third person (he, she, they, them).
Legal writing, policies, reports and ministerial letters often adopt a formal tone. You can also
use it in emails and letters when you have not yet met the person you are writing to.
Formal tone is used in ceremonies and to show respect for someone in authority.
Standard tone
Standard tone combines formal and informal tone. Most people find standard tone easiest to
understand.
Standard tone:
can use contractions and personal pronouns
(/node/131#there_are_different_kinds_of_pronouns)
doesnʼt use metaphors, idioms or slang.
You will probably use standard tone for most government content. This includes:
emails and letters
online government services
corporate communications
media releases
articles.
Informal tone
Informal tone uses contractions and personal pronouns.
Informal tone can use metaphors and idioms, which can have a negative effect on inclusion
(/node/178). Metaphors and idioms are not plain language.
You should not use slang when writing on behalf of government.
Informal tone is often used in social media (/node/43) and blogs (/node/44). Your writing
might also become more informal as you get to know the people you are writing to.07/09/2024, 13:28 Voice and tone | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/clear-language-and-writing-style/voice-and-tone 4/8Identify the right voice
Voice is sometimes called a persona. It refers to the personality implicit in the content.
Voice can be objective, formal and institutional, or it can be personal and friendly. The right
voice for content will depend on the persona fit for the content.
Voice and the elements of tone are closely connected. Voice can create a tone of equality (a
relationship between equals) or one that assumes authority (power is unequal).
A voice, or persona, can be:
supportive, friendly, positive and empowering
expert, impartial and balanced
serious and authoritative, but reasonable, legitimate and measured.
Check your organisationʼs style guide to see if it has advice about the organisationʼs voice.
If not, a safe place to start is with a basic government voice. It is the voice of a ‘definitive
sourceʼ and is:
respectful
clear and direct
objective and impartial.
A respectful writing style:
uses inclusive language (/node/178)
expresses ideas in everyday words
‘speaksʼ to people – using the pronoun ‘youʼ, for example
doesnʼt use inflammatory language, such as name-calling or sarcasm
doesnʼt speak down to people, but isnʼt too familiar either.
A clear and direct writing style:
is in plain language (/node/55)
uses active voice (/node/204)
is concise

Objective and impartial writing:
relies on facts
doesnʼt include opinion
is balanced and non-biased.
The difference between fact and opinion can be subtle.
Viewpoint affects perception of whether information is neutral or impartial. Adjectives and
adverbs can also affect whether the information comes across as fact or opinion.Write this

How people find information
How people find information
Design content based on the ways users find information.
Learn how users search for information
Do user research so you can work out how content will:
be found using different search strategies
answer the questions users ask
present the way users think it will
use everyday language – many search queries are voice search.
Include the main words and phrases that people search for. This is part of search engine
optimisation (SEO) (/node/103).
People use different strategies
Finding useful information online takes time and effort. People use different ways to:
look for information
browse through search results or content
assess the search results and content.
As people search for information, they often change what theyʼre looking for.07/09/2024, 13:29 How people ﬁnd information | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/ﬁndable-content/how-people-ﬁnd-information 1/8The way people look for information also changes with context. It can depend on
someoneʼs emotional state, their environment and what they are looking for. But some
people always use the same strategies to find content.
People go straight to information if they:
know about the topic
trust the source
have used the source before
know about the source because other people recommended it
have already found similar information in that source
have found the same content before.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/ﬁndable-content/how-people-ﬁnd-information 2/8People may use navigation, site search or both
People use government websites to complete a task or find information. They will browse
using navigation tools (menus and links), or use the siteʼs search function. They might also
do both.
Navigation
When browsing, it is easier for people to recognise a familiar term than it is for them to
remember the right keyword for a search. For this reason, some people prefer to navigate
using menus and links.
Others need to browse to discover new sources of information.
Some people wonʼt browse because site search is more effective for them.
Site search
People tend to use site search:
as a fallback when they canʼt find what they want using navigation tools
if they are looking for a particular document or product.
To help people who prefer to find information through site search, remember:
Complex websites need site search for finding content.
On very large websites, site search is often the best way to find pages that contain
specific phrases or keywords. These pages hold content that navigation tools might not
discover.
People may also use the site search function on the search engine results page, if the
site is configured to show this.
Familiar page structures are easier to
search
Familiar structures work best because people understand and expect them. The effort goes
into scanning and reading, rather than searching through content. Use the guidance on
content structure (/node/192).07/09/2024, 13:29 How people ﬁnd information | Style Manual

Understanding search engines
Understanding search engines
Metadata, keywords and page structure are important. Write and design
content so users can easily find it with search engines and voice search.
Search engines help users find content
Search engines:
index websites (using algorithms)
search the index
organise the results.
Examples include Bing, DuckDuckGo, Google and Yahoo.
Search engines use a process called indexing to look for content. Algorithms (automated
procedural instructions) do the indexing.
To index the content, algorithms use keywords in titles and metadata (/node/72). The HTML
<title> element is the heading that most search engines display in search results.
Algorithms change. Monitor how content is performing in search results and update it so you
are always using the right keywords.07/09/2024, 13:29 Understanding search engines | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/ﬁndable-content/understanding-search-engines 1/6Digital Service Standard requirements
You must understand the tools and systems used to build the service, and you must
test the service from end to end to meet the Digital Service Standard:
Criterion 4. Understand tools and systems (https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-
advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/4-understand-
tools-and-systems)
Criterion 10. Test the service (https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-
service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/10-test-service).
Plain language and helpful keywords
improve search
Most searches are short. More than 65% of search queries have three words or fewer. To
find out what words or terms people use, do user research (/node/76).
In general, to help people find content:
Use plain language (/node/55).
Include headings (/node/51).
Embed keywords in the metadata and content (/node/71).
For example, some departments use reference numbers instead of titles for some of their
forms. Without a title, algorithms canʼt find the forms easily. It also makes search harder for
users if they donʼt know the exact reference number for the form theyʼre looking for.
If you include a reference number, place it after the formʼs title so the algorithm can find the
form (/node/177).
Example
To find a government form a userʼs question might be, ‘What form do I need to fill out so
I can transfer ownership of my car?ʼ
What the user searches: ‘forms for selling a carʼ
Best search result: ‘Transfer your car to a new owner (Form 1066)ʼ07/09/2024, 13:29 Understanding search engines | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/ﬁndable-content/understanding-search-engines 2/6Accessibility requirements
User needs:
I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.
I can read and understand text, even if there are unusual words and shortened
forms, or languages other than English.
Fundamentals:
Ensure that the words people expect to see and are looking for are indexed by
search engines.
Write in plain language. This helps all users and is essential for some.
Level AAA requires a lower secondary education reading level, after removal of
proper names and titles (year 7 or between 12 and 14 years old).
Avoid (or explain) unusual words, phrases, idioms and so on. Expand all
acronyms on their first use.
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:
2.4.2 Page titled – level A (https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#page-

3.1.5 Reading level – level AAA

3.1.4 Abbreviations – level AAA
(https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#abbreviations)
Structure of pages affects search
Use the best structure for the type of content you need. In government content:
To put the most important content at the top of the page, use the inverted pyramid
(/node/77).
To lead people through a series of steps, use sequential structure (/node/78).07/09/2024, 13:29 Understanding search engines | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/ﬁndable-content/understanding-search-engines 3/6Include keywords that users relate to the topic in headings
(/node/51#use_keywords_to_start_headings) and final paragraphs (/node/53). Algorithms
look at these structural elements to assess and rank webpages.
Voice search may be longer and more
complex
Voice search is when people use the voice functions on their mobile and smart home devices
to find information online.
When people use voice search, they tend to use full questions and more informal language.
They donʼt use single words or short phrases as they would when they type a search term.
People using voice search will be able to find the content more easily if you:
avoid words that sound similar to other words (homophones) – for example, a voice
search could confuse the words ‘hearʼ and ‘hereʼ
create direct content that answers usersʼ questions.
People sometimes donʼt use their usual search engine when they use voice search. Design
content for more than one search engine to help people find what they need.

Keywords and search engines
Keywords and search engines
Keywords reflect core ideas and topics in content. Choosing the right keywords
will support peopleʼs ability to find the content they need when they search for
it online.
Match keywords to the search terms
people use
Using keywords helps people find content that meets their search intention. Keywords help
people:
find government services – for example, ‘myGov loginʼ
discover information – for example, ‘can I get paid maternity leave?ʼ
define a task – for example, ‘import wine to Australiaʼ.
Government content should help users find information and achieve what they need to do.
To write for users and search engines, you need to understand:
what users need to do with government
the keywords theyʼre likely to use.
Use this information to design content for people and search engines. You can combine it
with other techniques for on-page optimisation (/node/71).07/09/2024, 13:29 Keywords and search engines | Style Manual

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/ﬁndable-content/keywords-and-search-engines 2/5Write keyword-based content
To write content that users and search engines will discover:
Find out which keywords to use through a keyword tool, analytics and user research
(https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/build-and-improve-services/user-research). 
Write content using keywords and descriptive plain language (/node/55).
Structure content (/node/192) (including forms and online tools) so people find what
they need.
Include keywords once or twice, if they make sense, in the first paragraph of the content.
You can also include them in this way in the final paragraph.
Include terms and concepts that are closely related to the topic you are writing about. This
helps search engines understand the theme of the page.
Donʼt use too many keywords or keywords that are outside the context of the content. This is
known as keyword stuffing. Search engines ban or penalise this type of content.
Some information could relate to a specific place or a group of people. Make sure you
include these details (for example, ‘student placements in northern NSWʼ).
People must be able to discover information produced by Australian Government agencies.Example
You are writing content to help users find Australian embassies in Europe.
User research shows that when people search for an Australian embassy theyʼre either:
preparing to travel
needing help with an emergency situation.
The types of keywords you might use are:
embassy locations
emergency terms and current dangers
modes of travel
passport and visa terms.07/09/2024, 13:29 Keywords and search engines | Style Manual

On-page optimisation
Make content easy for people to find using search engines. Include keywords in
URLs, metadata and content. Create accessible links to high-quality content.
Optimise content for users first
Help people find the content they need using optimisation techniques.
On-page optimisation includes using keywords, metadata and links in the page content.
Website analytics tools can also help you optimise pages for search engines (/node/70).
Focus on making the page for users first, and for search engines second.
Example
Youʼre writing content to help users claim family tax benefits.
User research shows users look for ‘child careʼ, ‘incomeʼ and ‘paymentsʼ when they need
help with family tax benefits.
Write content that includes these terms and topics, and that answers the questions
people are most likely to ask.07/09/2024, 13:29 On-page optimisation | Style Manual

You must help the users of your service to find the information they need to meet the
Digital Service Standard (https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-
standard/digital-service-standard-criteria).
Use keywords in the URL and content
Use keywords in the:
web address (URL, or ‘uniform resource locatorʼ)
metadata
headings (/node/51)
page content (/node/72)
internal links (/node/193)
captions and alt text for images (/node/49).
Create URLs that contain words from the title of the page with the main keywords close to
the start.
The URL should be below 100 characters and make sense to the user.
To separate words in the URL, use hyphens instead of spaces or underscores. This helps
both people and search engines understand each word.
Write metadata that explains the page
Metadata is information about a webpage that search engines use. It also has other
information, such as the date when the webpage was published. Metadata sits in the code in
the background of a webpage.Example
https://stylemanual.gov.au/about-style-manual (https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/about-

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/ﬁndable-content/page-optimisation 2/8Two important parts of metadata display in search results:
the page title
the meta description.
Write these parts so that users can tell whether the page holds what theyʼre looking for.
Title
The title tells users and search engines what a page is about.
The title should:
include keywords
be different on each page
be shorter than 70 characters.
Titles that are too long will get cut off by search engines.
In a search result, the title is usually the first line. It works as a headline in the search results.
Accessibility requirements
User needs: 
I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.
Fundamentals:
Write clear page titles. This is the first thing a screen reader user will hear and
needs to assure them they are on the right page.
Ensure the linking text to this page relates to the title.Example

2.4.2 Page Titled Level A (https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?
showtechniques=242#page-titled)
Meta description
The <meta name="description"> field gives search engines a summary of the pageʼs
content. Search engines often use the description in the search result listing.
Describe the content in plain language (/node/194). This helps users to know if itʼs what they
need.
Descriptions need to be user-focused and contain keywords. They can be up to 160
characters. 
Search engines might also use a snippet of text from the content instead of a meta
description.
Create useful links to high-quality
content
Linking is the basis of the internet. The quality of the pages you link to affects the ranking of

User need:
I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.
Fundamentals:
Write link text that makes the destination and purpose of the link clear.
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

Use analytics as part of user research
Analytics are a convenient source for near-real-time information about users. They can help
you identify the language people use and give you hints about what they need.Example
Make sure users can read content on all devices using responsive design methods
(https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-
standard-criteria/6-consistent-and-responsive-design).

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/ﬁndable-content/page-optimisation 5/8Donʼt rely on analytics alone. Use analytics as part of research with users (/node/76).
Analytics that can support your research include:
keywords and phrases users are searching with
landing pages, site journeys and exit pages
the number of first-time and return visitors
the length of time users stay on a page
the volume of traffic and where itʼs coming from
most and least popular pages.
Be careful of using common metrics (like number of unique visits and time on page) as a
measure of success. A page might meet a userʼs need after a very quick visit.

Grammar, punctuation and conventions (/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions)>
Types of words
Types of words
Keep the functions of words in mind to write clear content. Grammar and
sentence structure help people understand meaning.
Words are grouped by function
Each word has a function in a sentence (/node/120), clause (/node/143) or phrase
(/node/144). You can group words into different types depending on the way they function.
Functions include:
adjectives (/node/126)
adverbs (/node/127)
conjunctions (/node/129)
determiners (/node/132)
nouns (/node/122)
prepositions (/node/130)
pronouns (/node/131)
verbs (/node/128).
Functional categories for words are also known as ‘parts of speechʼ.07/09/2024, 13:29 Types of words | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words 1/4Sentence structure sets the function of
words
Many individual words can belong to different word types. This depends on what the word is
doing in the sentence.
The function of the word depends on the role it plays in combination with others.
You can change the meaning of a sentence by moving a word.
Place modifying words, such as adjectives and adverbs, next to the thing that theyʼre
modifying. The same applies to adverbial and adjectival phrases and clauses.
If you donʼt put the modifier in the right place, people will find it difficult to understand your
content.
The following sentences are all grammatically correct. The meaning changes as the modifier
‘onlyʼ is moved.Example
You can face penalties for using a still to make alcohol without the proper licence.
[‘Stillʼ is a noun.]
The dinghy was floating in still water. [‘Stillʼ is an adjective.]
The people stood still during the national anthem. [‘Stillʼ is an adverb.]
Example
Only Jamilah told Freddie that she respected him. [No one else told Freddie.]
Jamilah only told Freddie that she respected him. [Jamilah didnʼt write to Freddie. She
just told him.]
Jamilah told only Freddie that she respected him. [Jamilah didnʼt tell anyone else she
respected him. She also didnʼt tell anyone else that she respected them.]
Jamilah told Freddie only that she respected him. [Jamilah didnʼt tell Freddie anything
else.]
Jamilah told Freddie that only she respected him. [No one else respects Freddie.]07/09/2024, 13:29 Types of words | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words 2/4Fixing a misplaced modifier is more complicated. Sentences with this issue often need some
rewriting.

Grammar, punctuation and conventions (/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions)>
Parts of sentences
Parts of sentences
A sentence is a group of words that makes sense on its own. Structure the
parts of a sentence so meaning is easy to understand.
A full sentence is grammatically
complete
Sentences can be statements, questions, exclamations or commands. A full sentence
expresses a complete idea.
Sentences contain at least a subject and a verb.
A basic sentence can have more components, for example:
who did something (the subject)
what they did (the verb)
who or what they did it to (the object or complement).
The verb plus the object or complement form the ‘predicateʼ. Not all sentences contain an
object or complement as part of the predicate.
A subject and verb can be enough to complete the subject–predicate structure of a
sentence.07/09/2024, 13:29 Parts of sentences | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/parts-sentences 1/8The predicate can sometimes appear as a whole sentence because the subject is implied.
This can depend on the ‘moodʼ of the verb (/node/128).
Subject
The subject is the person or thing that is doing the action in the sentence. The subject can
be a pronoun, noun, noun phrase or noun clause.
A noun phrase that is part of the subject is partially formed by determiners (such as ‘theʼ)
(/node/132).
Verb
The verb carries information about the subject. It affects the object or complement (if there
is one). It can convey an action, an event, a change or a state.Example
The manager moved. [The subject is ‘the managerʼ. The verb or predicate is ‘movedʼ.]
The manager moved their desk. [The subject is ‘the managerʼ. The verb is ‘movedʼ and
the object or complement is ‘their deskʼ. ‘Moved their deskʼ is the predicate.]
Example
Sign in. [The implied subject is ‘youʼ. The predicate is ‘sign inʼ.]
Confirm your password. [The implied subject is ‘youʼ. The predicate is the verb ‘confirmʼ,
plus the object or complement ‘your passwordʼ.]
Example
They met in the boardroom. [‘Theyʼ is the subject.]
People use the website to find information. [‘Peopleʼ is the subject.]
The Digital Service Standard has 13 criteria. [‘The Digital Service Standardʼ is the
subject.]
The heavy rain that fell last week subdued the fire. [‘The heavy rain that fell last weekʼ is
the subject.]07/09/2024, 13:29 Parts of sentences | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/parts-sentences 2/8Objects and complements
An object is the thing, person or concept that complements the verb. Objects can be direct
or indirect.
Some verbs have no action. They have complements that describe a quality or characteristic
of the subject.
Sentences are simple, compound or
complex
Simple sentences
A simple sentence contains only one main (or principal) clause (/node/143). This means it
has only one complete verb in it.Example
They met in the boardroom. [‘metʼ is the verb]
The meeting finished early. [‘finishedʼ is the verb]
They were all late. [‘wereʼ is the verb]
Example
Ravi sent clear instructions to the team.
[‘Clear instructionsʼ is the direct object of the verb ‘sentʼ. ‘The teamʼ is the indirect
object of the verb. Both objects plus the verb form the predicate.]
Example
Mary is the new office manager.
[‘Maryʼ is the subject. ‘The new office managerʼ complements the verb ‘isʼ. The
complement plus the verb forms the predicate.]
Example07/09/2024, 13:29 Parts of sentences | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/parts-sentences 3/8The subject can be implied by using a verb in the imperative mood.
Compound sentences
A compound sentence contains 2 or more main clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction
(‘andʼ, ‘orʼ, ‘butʼ, ‘soʼ). Each clause has a complete verb and could stand on its own.
If they have different subjects, use a comma before the coordinating conjunction.
If the 2 clauses share the same subject, donʼt repeat the subject or insert a comma before
the conjunction.
You could also write this as 2 short sentences, but this approach can appear repetitive.The Senate voted on the Aged Care Bill. [‘The Senateʼ is the subject. The verb is ‘votedʼ.
‘On the Aged Care Billʼ complements the verb to form the predicate.]
Example
Enter your verification code. [The implied subject is ‘youʼ. The verb is ‘enterʼ. ‘Your
verification codeʼ complements the verb to form the predicate.]
Example
The agency planned to start the project next year, but the group ran out of funding.
[‘Butʼ is the coordinating conjunction that joins the 2 main clauses.]
Example
The agency planned to start the project next year but ran out of funding. [‘The
agencyʼ is the subject of the verb ‘plannedʼ and the implied subject of the verb ‘ran outʼ.]
Example
The agency planned to start the project next year. The agency ran out of funding. [‘The
agencyʼ is the subject of both sentences.]07/09/2024, 13:29 Parts of sentences | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/parts-sentences 4/8Complex sentences
A complex sentence contains a main clause and at least one subordinate clause
(/node/143#subordinate_clauses_depend_on_the_main_clause).
You can start the sentence with the main clause.
You can also start the sentence with the subordinate clause to change the emphasis.
Passive voice changes standard
sentence order
Simple subject–verb–object sentences are standard in English. This order is clearer and
more accessible for people.
Build most sentences in this order with active voice when using active verbs (doing or action
verbs).
In passive voice, the ‘agentʼ of an active verb is not the grammatical subject in the sentence
order. Using active verbs with passive voice disguises who is doing what.Example
She finished the report before she left work. [The focus of the sentence is that ‘she
finished the reportʼ, which is the main clause.]
Example
Before she left work, she finished the report. [The focus of the sentence is that she
finished ‘before she left workʼ, which is the subordinate clause.]
Example
Wind forecasts are produced to show average speeds. [Passive voice: the grammatical
subject is ‘wind forecastsʼ. It does not answer the question, ‘Who or what produces wind
forecasts?ʼ]
Wind forecasts are produced by computer models to show average speeds. [Passive
voice with modified sentence structure: ‘by computer modelsʼ is an adverbial phrase
(/node/144). It answers the question, ‘Who or what produces wind forecasts?ʼ]07/09/2024, 13:29 Parts of sentences | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/parts-sentences 5/8Use passive voice only if there is a good reason – for example, if you canʼt say who did the
action or because information has to be concealed for ethical or legal reasons.

Punctuation
Punctuation
Use punctuation correctly to help readability and comprehension. Don't
overuse punctuation marks. The Style Manual follows the principles of minimal
punctuation and capitalisation.
Punctuation and capitalisation (/grammar-punctuation-and-
conventions/punctuation/punctuation-and-capitalisation)
Punctuation and capitalisation have rules for correct use. Use minimal punctuation
and capitalisation to make content more readable.
Apostrophes (/grammar-punctuation-and-
conventions/punctuation/apostrophes)
Apostrophes show possession and contractions. Donʼt use them in descriptive
phrases or to make nouns and shortened forms plural.07/09/2024, 13:30 Punctuation | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation 1/5Brackets and parentheses (/grammar-punctuation-and-
conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/brackets-and-
parentheses)
Brackets can help users scan text more easily. Only use brackets if you can remove
the enclosed text and the meaning does not change.
Colons (/grammar-punctuation-and-
conventions/punctuation/colons)
Colons draw attention to the text that follows. Only add colons that are essential. Use
them to introduce examples, contrasts, lists and block quotes.
Commas (/grammar-punctuation-and-
conventions/punctuation/commas)
Commas separate parts of a sentence so the meaning is clear. Sentence structure
determines their correct use.
Dashes (/grammar-punctuation-and-
conventions/punctuation/dashes)
Dashes show a relationship. Generally, en dashes for spans are less accessible for
users than a phrase. Use spaced en dashes to set off non-essential information in
sentences.07/09/2024, 13:30 Punctuation | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation 2/5Ellipses (/grammar-punctuation-and-
conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/ellipses)
Ellipses show users that ideas or words are missing from a sentence or a quote. Donʼt
use ellipses to change the intent of the original source.
Exclamation marks (/grammar-punctuation-and-
conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/exclamation-
marks)
Exclamation marks show emphasis and convey emotion. Only use them in informal
content.
Forward slashes (/grammar-punctuation-and-
conventions/punctuation/forward-slashes)
Forward slashes are useful in a small number of situations. Users are familiar with
them in mathematical expressions, dates, web addresses and in some shortened
forms.
Full stops (/grammar-punctuation-and-
conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/full-stops)
Full stops mark the end of sentences which aren't questions or exclamations. Users
need them to scan text and to recognise decimal values.07/09/2024, 13:30 Punctuation | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation 3/5Help us improve the Style ManualHyphens (/grammar-punctuation-and-
conventions/punctuation/hyphens)
Hyphens connect words and prefixes so meaning is clear. Refer to your organisationʼs
preferred dictionary when you are not sure if you need to use a hyphen for spelling.
Question marks (/grammar-punctuation-and-
conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/question-
marks)
Users expect direct questions and requests to end with a question mark. Indirect
questions, commands and rhetorical questions can take other punctuation.
Quotation marks (/grammar-punctuation-and-
conventions/punctuation/quotation-marks)
Quotation marks draw attention to words and reference certain kinds of titles. Write
most direct speech in single quote marks. For long quotes, use block quotes without
quotation marks.
Semicolons (/grammar-punctuation-and-
conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/semicolons)
Semicolons link sentences. They complicate sentences for users if overused. Do not
use them at the end of bullet and numbered list items.07/09/2024, 13:30 Punctuation | Style Manual

Grammar, punctuation and conventions (/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions)>Spelling
Spelling
Spelling errors detract from readability. Follow one dictionary for consistency
and use it to check variable spellings.
Choose one dictionary for consistency
Government organisations should choose one dictionary of Australian English.
This manual recommends either:
the Australian concise Oxford dictionary (ACOD)
the Macquarie dictionary.
Use your organisationʼs preferred dictionary as a spelling reference when you write. Spelling
and word usage can change over time. Make sure you use an up-to-date edition
that reflects current language usages.
Dictionaries include any variable spellings for words. Always use the first entry in the list.
This helps to ensure words are spelt consistently in government content.
Only use an alternative spelling listed for a word if you have evidence it will meet a user need
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/user-needs/understanding-needs/user-research-and-
content). Record decisions you make about alternative spellings in a style sheet
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/style-rules-and-conventions/general-conventions-editing-
and-proofreading/editing-and-proofreading#a_style_sheet_is_a_useful_tool).07/09/2024, 13:30 Spelling | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/spelling 1/4The entry for a spelling can expand on changes to the basic form of a word. These changes
show things like the plural, past tense, or the root from which a word is formed. These
changes are called ‘inflectionsʼ and ‘derivationsʼ.
Dictionaries will also show hyphenation (https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/style-rules-and-
conventions/punctuation-marks/hyphens), when to use capital letters
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/style-rules-and-conventions/general-conventions-editing-
and-proofreading/punctuation-and-
capitalisation#minimise_capitals_for_common_nouns_and_adjectives) and how to write
foreign words and phrases (https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/style-rules-and-
conventions/general-conventions-editing-and-
proofreading/italics#set_off_most_foreign_words_and_phrases).
Specialist dictionaries
General dictionaries wonʼt meet all needs. Other dictionaries may have helpful features, for
example:
more details on origins of words (etymologies)
clearer examples
word division for breaking words over lines of text
appendices.
Specialist dictionaries are essential for scientific or technical writing. The style sheet for the
content should include specialist terms.
Dictionaries describe language usages
English is a global language. There are many regional varieties of written and spoken English.
Dictionary spellings capture standard English words. Dictionaries also capture words and
usages particular to varieties of English, including Australian English.
Dictionaries are descriptive not prescriptive. They describe how people actually use and
spell English rather than prescribing rules for using English correctly. Dictionaries objectively
record language for the people who speak it.
This is why dictionary entries include different meanings for each word and alternative
spellings. The important thing is to use the word that matches the meaning you want to
convey.07/09/2024, 13:30 Spelling | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/spelling 2/4Most words have a single spelling. This can lead people to assume there is always a ‘correct
spellingʼ. But spellings arenʼt uniform or consistent around the world. Australian, British and
American English share words that have the same meaning, but can be spelt differently.
Australian spellings generally follows British spellings, but there are exceptions. For
Australian spellings, always use an Australian English dictionary.
In addition, style guides (like the Style Manual) usually have guidance for their users about
how to write specific terms and phrases.
Follow guidance in this manual
The Style Manual has specific guidance about writing certain terms and phrases correctly.
Follow our guidance for:
names and terms, including Australian place names (/node/117)
titles, honours and forms of address (/node/149)
numbers and measurements (/node/138)
terms that support inclusion (/node/178)
common misspellings and word confusion (/node/121).
There is also guidance related to spelling at punctuation and capitalisation (/node/116).
Spelling in this manual
The spelling in this manual follows the sixth edition of the ACOD. This dictionary reflects
Australian English usage.
Style Manual also recognises conventions and spellings particular to government content.
The spellings used by Australian Government organisations that follow the Macquarie
dictionary might differ from those in this manual. This is perfectly acceptable – choose either
of our recommended dictionaries (or a specialist dictionary) and follow it consistently.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/spelling 3/4Users might notice that the Style Manual departs from some spellings used in the sixth
edition. For example, we now write ‘ementʼ not ‘mentʼ in acknowledgement, lodgement and
judgement (but we use ‘judgmentʼ for legal material (https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/style-

current advice in Australian English dictionaries.

Hierarchical structure
A hierarchy sorts content into categories and levels. This structure can give
users a picture of how items or topics fit together.
Show how categories relate to one
another
Hierarchies structure content by category. They show how different categories relate to each
other, and how they relate to the main idea or theme.
This structure is the basis for the information architecture of many websites. It also suits
organisational charts and other visual content that ranks items in a hierarchy of relationships.
To structure content hierarchically:
Plan the headings (/node/51).
Decide what information fits under each heading.
Plan subheadings.
Keep the hierarchy shallow – use no more than 4 heading levels.
Check the headings for consistency and logic.

Types of structure (/structuring-content/types-structure)>Inverted pyramid structure
Inverted pyramid structure
The inverted pyramid starts with what the user most needs to know. Order the
rest of the page from most to least important information.
Use the inverted pyramid for most
content
The basic structure of the inverted pyramid is:
a heading
details in order, from the most to the least important.
The most important idea comes first or ‘above the foldʼ. This is the top part of a screen or a
newspaper, where people can see the main idea at a glance.
This structure helps users scan content on any device. It also helps optimise the page for
search engines (/node/103).07/09/2024, 13:40 Inverted pyramid structure | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/types-structure/inverted-pyramid-structure 1/4Start with what the user most needs to
know
To structure your content as an inverted pyramid:
Write the main idea in as few words as possible. It can be a summary, a conclusion or
recommendation, or the action someone needs to take.
Describe the main ideas in headings (/node/51). 
Under each of the top-level headings, group the content under subheadings
(/node/51#organise_headings_in_a_logical_order). This helps people find supporting
information.
Write supporting paragraphs (/node/53).
Organise the information in order of importance.Example
An inverted pyramid is a structure for a piece of content: important detail
comes first07/09/2024, 13:40 Inverted pyramid structure | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/types-structure/inverted-pyramid-structure 2/4For long-form content, use a summary or a list of recommendations in the preliminary pages.
This helps people read the main information with ease.
Design pages based on how the user
scans
People start at the top of a page and decide within seconds whether to go past the initial
view.
The headline and the first few lines provide the main reason for staying (or leaving). As
people read through the content, they might also scan pictures or other headings, but they
could also stop reading at any time.
The inverted pyramid works because people pay more attention when they first see the
content. Their interest tends to wane in the middle, and sometimes they never reach the end.
Journalists know thatʼs how readers behave and structure content accordingly.
To structure a paragraph using the inverted pyramid, start with a topic sentence. Use the
rest of the paragraph to explain the topic sentence.

Grammar, punctuation and conventions (/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions)>
Types of words (/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words)>Adverbs
Adverbs
Adverbs modify meaning when theyʼre added to a sentence. Use them
occasionally to show people how, when, where, or the extent to which
something happens.
Adverbs add more information about
other types of words
Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives and other adverbs. They often, but not always, end in ‘-lyʼ.
Adverbs can affect clarity
Use adverbs sparingly. Remove any adverb that doesnʼt play a critical function in a sentence
(/node/204).Example
The staff worked happily. [Modifies the verb ‘workedʼ]
The staff arrived early this morning. [Modifies the verb ‘arrivedʼ]
She is a very dedicated worker. [Modifies the adjective ‘dedicatedʼ]
You finished quite quickly. [Modifies the adverb ‘quicklyʼ]07/09/2024, 13:50 Adverbs | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/adverbs 1/4Because adverbs are modifiers, they can affect clarity. A lack of clarity can cause users to
lose trust in government content.
Comparison with adverbs is by degree
Like adjectives, adverbs can have degree to show or imply a comparison. In general, you
simply add the word ‘moreʼ or ‘mostʼ in front of the adverb.
Depending on the context, some words can be adjectives or adverbs (/node/203). Make sure
you use the correct form. For example, ‘quickestʼ is the adjective and ‘most quicklyʼ is the
adverb.
Not all adverbs follow this regular pattern of using ‘moreʼ or ‘mostʼ to show comparison. The
following examples show irregular adverbs.
Adverbs donʼt always show or imply comparison. These are called positive adverbs.Example
Comparative
Bob spoke more quickly than Tom. [Uses ‘moreʼ to compare Tomʼs and Bobʼs speaking
speed]
Superlative
Tom speaks more quickly than Bob, but Harry speaks the most quickly of them all. [Uses
‘mostʼ to compare Harryʼs speaking speed to that of the others]
Example
He spoke well, but she spoke better.
You finished work early, but they finished even earlier.
Example
Tom spoke quickly. [Tomʼs speaking speed is not compared with anything else.]
The staff worked happily. [We donʼt know if they worked more happily than others.]07/09/2024, 13:50 Adverbs | Style Manual

Grammar, punctuation and conventions (/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions)>
Types of words (/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words)>Adjectives
Adjectives
Adjectives describe, compare and define nouns and words that act as nouns.
Use adjectives to help people understand meaning.
Adjectives describe nouns
Adjectives describe nouns (/node/122), noun phrases
(/node/144#noun_phrases_function_as_a_noun) and noun clauses (/node/143).
Adjectives usually go immediately before the noun. They can go elsewhere in a sentence –
for example, as a predicate (/node/120).
Adjectives also modify noun phrases and noun clauses.Example
They had a short conversation. [The adjective ‘shortʼ describes the noun ‘conversationʼ.]
Their conversation was short. [The adjective ‘shortʼ describes the noun ‘conversationʼ,
but appears as the predicate in this sentence.]
Example
They had a short conversation about the meeting. [A noun phrase]
They had a short conversation that led to a decision. [A noun clause]07/09/2024, 13:50 Adjectives | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/adjectives 1/7Different types of words, such as nouns, can also function as adjectives.
Adjectives can affect clarity
Use adjectives sparingly and only when they are essential for meaning. Remove any
adjective that doesnʼt play a critical function in a sentence
(https://dtg.govcms.gov.au/node/204).
Because adjectives are modifiers, they can affect clarity. A lack of clarity can cause users to
lose trust in government content.
Compound adjectives can have hyphens
Adjectives can be joined with hyphens to make compound adjectives
(/node/105#use_hyphens_for_some_compound_words). A compound adjective usually has a
hyphen if the adjective is before the noun it is describing.
A compound adjective can be made up of an adverb (/node/127) and a verb
(https://dtg.govcms.gov.au/verbs).
A common error with adverbs and hyphens is when people insert a hyphen into this kind of
compound adjective. Donʼt use hyphens with most adverbs finishing in ‘-lyʼ.Example
A moving speech brought the sound of applause. [A verbal noun (gerund) functioning as
an adjective]
Example
We need a fit-for-purpose strategy to solve this specific problem. [Adjective before the
noun ‘strategyʼ]
The strategy is fit for purpose. [Adjective after the noun ‘strategyʼ]
Correct
A badly worded sentence can be difficult to read, even if it is grammatically correct.07/09/2024, 13:50 Adjectives | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/adjectives 2/7There are few exceptions to this rule, so check a dictionary if you are unsure.
Most adjectives use different degrees
for comparisons
Degree shows the relative scale of the words being described, such as speed, size or quality.
Most adjectives can have ‘degreeʼ.
These adjectives usually follow the pattern of adding ‘-erʼ or ‘-estʼ to the end to show the
degree.
Not all adjectives follow the regular pattern of ‘fast–faster–fastestʼ. These irregular adjectives
have different patterns.Incorrect
A badly-worded sentence can be difficult to read, even if it is grammatically-correct.
Example
Positive
Claire is a fast talker. [There is no comparison. Claire is fast.]
Comparative
Sam is a faster talker than Claire. [Adds ‘-erʼ to compare Claireʼs and Samʼs talking
speed.]
Superlative
Sam is faster than Claire, but Petra is the fastest of them all. [Adds ‘-estʼ to compare
Petraʼs talking speed to that of the others.]
Example
little, less, least
good, better, best07/09/2024, 13:50 Adjectives | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/adjectives 3/7Some adjectives donʼt have a different form to show degree. They show degree by using
‘moreʼ for comparative or ‘mostʼ for superlative.
Some adjectives donʼt have degree because you canʼt compare them. For example, nothing
can be more unique than something else.
There is a common order for strings of
adjectives
Write strings of adjectives in an order that creates a more natural-sounding English. This
order is determined by the types of adjectives used. List adjectives in this order:
 . evaluative – features of a noun that you can measure or compare 
 . descriptive – features of a noun that you canʼt measure
 . definitive – features of a noun that are intrinsic to the noun.
Evaluative adjectives can also express an opinion.
In this example:
‘beautifulʼ is evaluative because it expresses an opinion
‘roundʼ is descriptive because itʼs a feature you can observe but canʼt measure
‘committeeʼ is definitive because it is intrinsic to the noun ‘tableʼ.
Strings of adjectives have:bad, worse, worst
Example
The department decided on a more flexible approach to working arrangements.
This is the most significant reform of public health policy in decades.
Example
A beautifulroundcommittee table07/09/2024, 13:50 Adjectives | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/adjectives 4/7commas between adjectives of the same type
no commas between adjectives of different types
no commas and no ‘andʼ before definitive adjectives.
You can also use ‘andʼ instead of commas to help the sentence flow more smoothly
(/node/109).
The meaning of nouns and adjectives
shouldnʼt overlap
Donʼt use an adjective if it repeats a quality or property that is part of the noun.Example
A large, blacknuclear submarine [‘Largeʼ and ‘blackʼ are descriptive; ‘nuclearʼ is
definitive.]
A new, redlong-rangeelectric car [‘Newʼ and ‘redʼ are descriptive; ‘long-rangeʼ and
‘electricʼ are definitive.]
Example
A new and shiny red long-range electric car
Example
absolute perfection [Perfection is always absolute.]

Types of words (/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words)>Conjunctions
Conjunctions
Conjunctions join whole sentences or parts of a sentence together. They can
show people how ideas are linked, or how ideas contrast.
Conjunctions join words, phrases and

Use conjunctions to connect words, phrases (/node/144) and clauses (/node/143).
Examples of conjunctions are:

Some conjunctions come in pairs, such as ‘whether/orʼ, ‘either/orʼ and ‘neither/norʼ. Each
conjunction in the pair should appear before the same type of word, phrase or clause.
Coordinating conjunctions join things of
equal importance
Coordinating conjunctions include ‘andʼ, ‘butʼ and ‘orʼ. They link words, phrases and clauses
that are of the same importance.
Coordinating conjunctions can also join clauses that could stand alone as sentences.Give me a call when you have finished the report.
Example
Whether rain or shine, weʼre going ahead with the team-building exercise. [Both
conjunctions pair with a noun.]
My manager and I discussed both my performance review and my career prospects.
[Both conjunctions pair with a noun phrase.]
Either we complete the report today, or we work on it tomorrow. [Both conjunctions pair
with clauses.]
Example
The Australian Defence Force will build new patrol boats and submarines. [Joining
nouns]
Work quickly but carefully. [Joining adverbs]
The answer is true or false. [Joining adjectives]
The content designers had Post-its on the wall and on the floor. [Joining phrases]
Schools reopened so students returned. [Joining clauses]07/09/2024, 13:51 Conjunctions | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/conjunctions 2/6Subordinating conjunctions join clauses
and phrases to a main clause
Subordinating conjunctions join the main clause to a subordinate (or ‘dependentʼ) clause or
phrase.
The main clause can stand alone as a sentence. Dependent clauses add to the main clause:
they depend on it to form a complete sentence (/node/120).
Examples of subordinating conjunctions are:
when
if
unless
until
because
since.
Some adverbs work as conjunctions
A conjunctive adverb is a word that does 2 things at the same time.
It joins 2 main clauses.
It modifies a verb, an adjective, another adverb or a whole clause.Example
Keep the sentence simple otherwise the message will get lost.
Example
When you get to work, please phone your new client. [‘Please phone your new clientʼ is
the main clause; ‘when you get to workʼ is the dependent clause.]
Take care of your health as though your life depends on it. [‘Take care of your healthʼ is
the main clause; ‘your life depends on itʼ is the dependent clause.]07/09/2024, 13:51 Conjunctions | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/conjunctions 3/6They are weaker connections than coordinating or subordinating conjunctions.
Conjunctive adverbs are often not needed. They add nuance to writing, but use them
sparingly. You can usually delete them and keep meaning clear.
‘Withʼ is not a conjunction
Donʼt use ‘withʼ to add a clause at the beginning or end of a sentence. Reword or split the
sentence to prevent this misuse. This helps create shorter, simpler sentences that are easier
to read.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/conjunctions 4/6The sixth edition had information about conjunctions in many sections of the manual.
The Content Guide did not have any information about conjunctions.

Types of words (/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words)>Determiners
Determiners
Determiners always go with a noun. They tell people something specific or
general about the noun.
Determiners are ‘articlesʼ that go with
nouns
Determiners introduce a noun (/node/122) or a noun phrase (/node/144). Determiners give
more information about the noun they are introducing. They are also called ‘articlesʼ.
They show users:
which things you are referring to
whether you are referring to specific or to generic things and ideas
how many things there are.
Determiners include:
articles such as ‘aʼ, ‘anʼ or ‘theʼ
pronouns such as ‘thoseʼ, ‘myʼ or ‘someʼ
numbers such as ‘2ʼ, ‘14ʼ or ‘23 millionʼ.07/09/2024, 13:51 Determiners | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/determiners 1/6Definite articles refer to a specific thing
or things
The word ‘theʼ is the ‘definite articleʼ. It defines which specific thing you are referring to.
You can use ‘theʼ for a group of things, but only if you refer to a specific group.
Donʼt use ‘theʼ when you make a generalisation.
Indefinite articles let you make
generalisations
The words ‘aʼ and ‘anʼ are ‘indefinite articlesʼ. Use them when you are referring to a generic
thing or idea rather than a specific one.
Choose ‘aʼ or ‘anʼ according to the sound of the word after it:Example
They finished the report on time and on budget. [This sentence refers to a specific
report.]
Example
The employees were on time for the meeting. [Specific employees were on time.]
Example
People work in offices. [This is a generalisation about people and offices.]
Example
A school should teach a child how to read and write. [This could be any school and any
child.]
An EL2 usually supervises several staff. [This could be any EL2.]07/09/2024, 13:51 Determiners | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/determiners 2/6Use ‘aʼ if the following word starts with a consonant sound.
Use ‘anʼ if the following word starts with a vowel sound.
The same rule applies to shortened words and phrases (abbreviations (/node/184), acronyms
and initialisms (/node/190), and contractions (/node/191)).
Some vowels have a hidden ‘yʼ consonant sound at the beginning. For example, you would
read ‘universalʼ as ‘yew-nee-ver-sahlʼ.
Say the noun out loud. If it starts with the hidden ‘yʼ sound, use ‘aʼ.
For words that start with ‘hʼ:
Use ‘anʼ only before words that start with a silent ‘hʼ, such as ‘honourʼ or ‘hourʼ.
Use ‘aʼ for all other words starting with ‘hʼ, such as ‘historianʼ or 'hotelʼ, when the ‘hʼ is
spoken.
Pronouns can function as determiners
Some pronouns introduce nouns, so they work as determiners. Examples of these pronouns
are ‘anyʼ, ‘someʼ, ‘thisʼ, ‘thatʼ, ‘theseʼ, ‘thoseʼ, ‘myʼ, ‘yourʼ, ‘hisʼ, ‘herʼ.
Pronouns, working as determiners, can show which noun you are referring to.Example
It was an error. [The ‘eʼ sound in ‘errorʼ is a vowel.]
It was a cold office. [The ‘cʼ sound in ‘coldʼ is a consonant.]
The job required a university degree. [The ‘uʼ sound in ‘universityʼ sounds like the
consonant ‘yʼ.]
Example
Write some instructions.
Those meetings were long but fruitful.
Give it your best shot.07/09/2024, 13:51 Determiners | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/determiners 3/6Pronouns can also quantify the noun.
Numbers can function as determiners
Numbers work as determiners because they give information about how many nouns they
are introducing.

Types of words (/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words)>Nouns
Nouns
Nouns are the words that name people, places, organisations and things. Style
and grammar support how people interpret nouns in content.
Proper nouns are the names of people
and specific things
Any name for a specific person, organisation, place or thing is a ‘proper nounʼ.
Proper nouns always start with capital letters, except for some commercial terms (/node/89).
There are specific capitalisation conventions for the:
titles of office holders (/node/149)Example
June
Shark Bay
Collingwood Football Club
Torres Strait Regional Authority
Prime Minister of Australia07/09/2024, 13:51 Nouns | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/nouns 1/9names of organisations (/node/88)
government terms (/node/136).
Common nouns are words for generic
things
Common nouns describe people, places, times or things in a general sense. They have a
capital letter only when they are the first word in a sentence.
Capitalise nouns only if they are part of a proper noun. Donʼt capitalise them if you use them
as common nouns.
Common nouns can be concrete or
abstract
Concrete nouns name things you can identify through one or more of the 5 senses.Example
month
coast
local government
prime ministers
Example
The ACTʼs Office of the Commissioner for the Environment was the first such agency in
Australia. [‘Officeʼ is part of the formal title.]
I worked in the office for 11 years. [‘Officeʼ is not part of the formal title, even if it refers
to the Office of the Commissioner for the Environment.]
Example
server07/09/2024, 13:51 Nouns | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/nouns 2/9Abstract nouns name intangible things. These include ideas, emotions and physical feelings.
Some nouns can be either concrete or abstract, depending on the context.
Verbal nouns are also called ‘gerundsʼ
Gerunds are nouns that form by attaching an ‘-ingʼ to a verb.
You can combine gerunds and other verbal nouns with a determiner
(/node/132#pronouns_can_function_as_determiners) (such as ‘myʼ or ‘yourʼ).phone
software
person
Example
honesty
reliance
engagement

Example
The office is upstairs. [Concrete noun]
Alfred Deakin was the first to hold the office of Attorney-General in Australia. [Abstract
noun]
Example
meet [verb], meeting [noun]
report [verb], reporting [noun]07/09/2024, 13:51 Nouns | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/nouns 3/9Verbal nouns also include nouns that relate to verbs in another way. For example, the noun
can form by adding other types of suffix to a verb like ‘-ationʼ or ‘-mentʼ. These are not
gerunds.
Other verbal nouns donʼt have any suffix but have the same spelling as the verb. It is context
that gives the distinction.
Nouns can be singular or plural
Nouns can be singular or plural. Most English words add an ‘-sʼ or ‘-esʼ to form the plural,
but there are many exceptions. Check a dictionary if youʼre not sure.Example
Your writing has improved. [‘Yourʼ is the determiner; ‘writingʼ is the noun; ‘has improvedʼ
is the verb.]
They resent Billʼs laughing at them. [‘Billʼsʼ is the determiner; ‘resentʼ is the verb;
‘laughingʼ is the noun.]
Example
fixation [Noun related to the verb ‘fixʼ]
attachment [Noun related to the verb ‘attachʼ]
Example
‘fix the issueʼ [verb], ‘a quick fixʼ [noun]
‘report an issueʼ [verb], ‘annual report to the ministerʼ [noun]
Example
a computer, many computers
a policy, many policies
the standby, many standbys07/09/2024, 13:51 Nouns | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/nouns 4/9Some nouns donʼt change to form the plural.
Donʼt use an apostrophe before (or after) the ‘sʼ to show the plural.
Collective nouns describe a group in a
single word
Collective nouns are a type of common noun. They label groups of people or things.
Subject–verb agreement
A collective noun usually has a singular verb (/node/128). This is so, even if itʼs made up of
component parts.the Attorney-General, many attorneys-general
Example
an aircraft, many aircraft
Correct
Adjust the desks and chairs.
Incorrect

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/nouns 5/9An exception is when you need to draw attention to the individual parts of the collective
noun.
Nouns can be countable or uncountable
You can sort nouns by whether they can be separated into individual units and counted:
You can count countable nouns.
You cannot count uncountable nouns.
A countable singular noun must have a determiner.The government intends to act.
The committee is meeting.
Incorrect
The government intend to act.
The committee are meeting.
Example
The branch meets once a week. [‘The branchʼ, as a whole, meets once a week. The
singular form of the verb is used.]
The branch are divided over the new meeting schedule. [The individuals in ‘the branchʼ
have different opinions about the new meeting schedule. The plural form of the verb is
used.]
Example
Would you like a cup of coffee or tea? [‘Cupʼ is countable; ‘coffeeʼ and ‘teaʼ are
uncountable.]
Correct
The report is being printed.07/09/2024, 13:51 Nouns | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/nouns 6/9An uncountable noun has no plural and only a singular verb. Uncountable nouns donʼt need
to have a determiner. Whether it has one depends on the meaning of the sentence.
Some nouns can be used both ways. The meaning depends on whether the noun is
countable or uncountable in the way it is used:
In the uncountable form, it refers to the whole idea or quantity.
In the countable form, it refers to a specific example or type.
Noun trains are hard to understand
Strings of 3 or more nouns are known as ‘noun trainsʼ. Each noun in a noun train modifies the
next.
Rewrite a sentence to avoid using a noun train. This will help you write in plain language

Incorrect
Report is being printed.
Example
Respect is an Australian Public Service value. [No determiner with ‘respectʼ. The value is
not quantifiable.]
The leadership avoided a spill. [‘Theʼ is the determiner with ‘leadershipʼ. The noun refers
to a single, specific group of people.]
Example
Language is powerful. [In this context, ‘languageʼ is uncountable.]
Australians speak many languages besides English. [In this context, ‘languageʼ is
countable.]07/09/2024, 13:51 Nouns | Style Manual

Prepositions
A preposition creates relationships between words or phrases. Some words
only work with specific prepositions. Choose them deliberately to convey
meaning to users.
A preposition creates relationships

information about the time and place of an action or thing.
Examples of prepositions are:
in

Prepositions often come before related words or phrases (/node/144).07/09/2024, 13:51 Prepositions | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/prepositions 1/4You can use some prepositions as a different type of word, depending on their function in
the sentence. For example, 'down' can be a preposition, part of a verb or an adverb.
Some words only work with specific
prepositions
Not all prepositions work for every word or phrase. Some words are always followed by
particular prepositions. For example, 'different' is always followed by 'to' or 'from', but not by
'than'. Check a dictionary if you are not sure.Example
Put the book on the table. ['On' shows the position of 'the book' in relation to 'the
table'.]
During her time in office, she launched 50 projects. ['During' refers to 'her time'; 'in'
refers to 'office'.]

I walked down the hill. ['Down' is a preposition.]
Prices came down from an all-time high. ['Down' is part of the phrasal verb 'came down'.
'From' is the preposition.]

Types of words (/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words)>Pronouns
Pronouns
Pronouns replace other words. People will find content easier to read when
pronouns match their context.
Pronouns stand in for other words
Pronouns stand in for nouns (/node/122). They stand in for groups of words that function as
nouns (noun phrases (/node/144) and noun clauses
(/node/143#subordinate_clauses_depend_on_the_main_clause)). They can also act like
determiners (/node/132).
Pronouns can be singular or plural.Example
I, he, she, they, it
myself, yourself, ourselves
who, which, that
any, several
Example
I, we
she, they07/09/2024, 13:52 Pronouns | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/pronouns 1/7Types of pronouns function as different
types of words
There are 6 main types of pronouns:
Personal pronouns replace the names of people or things. They include ‘Iʼ, ‘meʼ, ‘weʼ, ‘usʼ,
‘itʼ, ‘theyʼ, ‘themʼ, ‘sheʼ, ‘herʼ, ‘heʼ and ‘himʼ.
Reflexive pronouns reflect the action of the verb back to the subject. They include
‘myselfʼ, ‘ourselvesʼ, ‘itselfʼ, ‘themselfʼ, ‘themselvesʼ, ‘herselfʼ and ‘himselfʼ.
Relative pronouns refer to nouns that are already known from the context. They include
‘whoʼ, ‘whomʼ, ‘whoseʼ, ‘whichʼ and ‘thatʼ.
Interrogative pronouns ask questions. They include ‘whatʼ, ‘whichʼ, ‘whoʼ, ‘whomʼ and
‘whoseʼ.
Demonstrative pronouns specify which noun you are referring to. They include ‘thisʼ,
‘thatʼ, ‘theseʼ and ‘thoseʼ.
Indefinite pronouns donʼt specify quantity or number. They include ‘anyʼ, ‘eachʼ, ‘severalʼ
and ‘someʼ.
Some pronouns can work as other types of words. For example, ‘myʼ, ‘hisʼ, ‘hersʼ, ‘ourʼ, ‘theirʼ
and ‘yourʼ work as determiners.
Singular pronouns have a gender-neutral form. Use the forms:me, us
Example
I gave her the report. She gave me a card. [Personal pronouns]
I told myself I could finish on time. [Reflexive pronoun]
The person who wrote the report has left. [Relative pronoun]
Who left the lights on in the office? [Interrogative pronoun]
This is mine. That one is yours. [Demonstrative pronouns]
Do you have any feedback? Yes, I have some. [Indefinite pronouns]07/09/2024, 13:52 Pronouns | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/pronouns 2/7‘theyʼ instead of ‘heʼ or ‘sheʼ
‘themʼ instead of ‘himʼ or ‘herʼ
‘theirʼ instead of ‘hisʼ or ‘hersʼ.
Pronouns take different forms
depending on their function
The form of a pronoun will change depending on whether it is the subject or the object of the
verb. This is the ‘caseʼ of the pronoun.
A pronoun used as the subject in a sentence is in the subjective case (for example, ‘Iʼ, ‘theyʼ).
A pronoun used as the object in a sentence is in the objective case (for example, ‘meʼ,
‘themʼ).
When the singular ‘theyʼ is used in a sentence as a gender-neutral
(/node/64#use_genderneutral_language) term, it takes the plural form of a verb.
Use the correct case when writing pronouns. Check whether the pronoun should be in the
subjective or the objective case – whether it is the subject or object
(/node/120#a_full_sentence_is_grammatically_complete).Example
I emailed them. [‘Iʼ is the subject and ‘themʼ is the object.]
They emailed me. [‘Theyʼ is the subject and ‘meʼ is the object.]
Correct
My colleague and I travelled with the delegation.
My manager sent their director and me an email.
Incorrect
My colleague and me travelled with the delegation.
My manager sent their director and I an email.07/09/2024, 13:52 Pronouns | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/pronouns 3/7Sentences can have reflexive pronouns when the subject is also the object of the verb.
Donʼt use a reflexive pronoun if the subject and the object are not the same person or thing.
Donʼt use reflexive pronouns such as ‘yourselfʼ and ‘myselfʼ as the subject of the verb.
Relative pronouns show essential or
non-essential information
To make your writing clear, use:
‘thatʼ for essential information
‘whichʼ, with punctuation, for non-essential information.Example
The manager emailed themself. [‘Themselfʼ is the object but refers to ‘the managerʼ,
which is the subject.]
Correct
I emailed myself.
Incorrect
The manager emailed myself.
Correct
My colleague and I travelled with the delegation.
Incorrect
My colleague and myself travelled with the delegation.07/09/2024, 13:52 Pronouns | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/pronouns 4/7It is important to show users whether information is essential or non-essential by using
punctuation, for example commas
(/node/109#mark_out_nonessential_information_within_a_sentence).
Choosing between relative pronouns can be a matter of style in some situations, depending
on voice and tone (/node/40). It is the use of punctuation with the relative pronoun that
clarifies meaning.
 to use gender-neutral language. It also had some information on
using pronouns for tone (/node/40).Example
The farm that produces oats is for sale. [The only farm that is for sale is the one that
produces oats.]
The farm,which produces oats, is for sale. [The farm, which happens to produce oats, is
for sale.]07/09/2024, 13:52 Pronouns | Style Manual

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/verbs 1/9Verbs must ‘agreeʼ with the subject
The form of the verb changes to show whether the subject is singular or plural (the number).
This is called ‘subject–verb agreementʼ.
To decide which form of the verb you need, find its subject and ask ‘whoʼ or ‘whatʼ is doing
the verb. Using the first example:
Question: Who works in the office on Mondays?
Answer: The analyst.
This answer might seem obvious, but subject–verb agreement is not always intuitive. For
example, a common mistake is to use the plural form of a verb with a collective noun
(/node/122#collective_nouns_describe_a_group_in_a_single_word).
Sentences contain at least a subject and a verb
(/node/120#a_full_sentence_is_grammatically_complete). Keep the relationship between the
grammatical subject and the verb clear to users. This relationship is the basis for writing
plain language sentences (/node/204#write_plain_language_sentences).
Objects complement some verbs
Some verbs need an object to have meaning. For example, you donʼt just need or take – you
need ‘somethingʼ or take ‘somethingʼ. These are ‘transitiveʼ verbs.Correct
The analyst works in the office on Mondays. [There is one specific analyst, so the verb
takes the singular form ‘worksʼ.]
Incorrect
Jan work in the office on Mondays. [There is one person, Jan, so the verb should not
take the plural form ‘workʼ.]
Example
They need advice before the hearing. [‘Adviceʼ is the object of the verb ‘needʼ.]07/09/2024, 13:52 Verbs | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/verbs 2/9Some verbs donʼt have an object. These are ‘intransitiveʼ verbs. Intransitive verbs can
instead have a complement in the form of an adverb (/node/127) or adverbial phrase
(/node/144).
Some verbs can be transitive or intransitive. They can have meaning with or without an
object, depending on the rest of the sentence.
A complement can go with a verb that links the subject to an attribute, quality or
characteristic. This type of complement is not an object, but completes the sentence. They
are often adjectival phrases (/node/144#adjectival_phrases_function_as_adjectives) or
adjectives (/node/126).Take my advice. [‘My adviceʼ is the object of the verb ‘takeʼ.]
Example
The power grid failed. [The verb ‘failedʼ does not have an object.]
The candidate campaigned tirelessly. [The verb ‘campaignedʼ does not have an object.
‘Tirelesslyʼ is an adverb. The adverb complements the verb.]
Example
They opened the door. [The object is ‘the doorʼ.]
The door opened. [‘Openedʼ has no object.]
Example
The door is open. [‘Openʼ complements the verb ‘isʼ. It is an adjective that describes the
subject, ‘the doorʼ.]
The forecasts seem reasonable. [‘Reasonableʼ complements the verb ‘seemʼ. It is an
adjective describes the subject, ‘the forecastsʼ.]
Each agency has its own arrangements. [‘Its own arrangementsʼ complements the verb
‘hasʼ. The complement is a noun phrase describing an attribute of the subject, ‘each
agencyʼ.]07/09/2024, 13:52 Verbs | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/verbs 3/9Tense changes the form of the verb
The form of the verb can also change to show:
when something happened (past, present or future) – this is the tense of the verb
whether something is continuing or has finished.
Verbs like ‘willʼ change the form of the main verb ‘to writeʼ. Verbs added to the main verb are
‘auxiliaryʼ verbs.
The ‘moodʼ of a verb conveys meaning
You can use verbs to describe a fact, express a wish, or make a command or request. The
term for this use is ‘moodʼ.
Indicative mood
This mood expresses simple statements or questions.Example
I was writing the report last week, but I couldnʼt finish it. [The action is in the past tense
and is continuing. I didnʼt finish writing the report last week.]
I wrote the report yesterday. [The action is in the past tense and has finished.]
I am writing another report today. [The action is in the present tense and it is
continuing.]
I will write a final report tomorrow. [The action is in the future tense and it will be finished
tomorrow.]
By next week, the executive will have reviewed the report. [The action is in the future
tense and will be finished by next week.]
Example
Jan went into the office on Monday.
The commander ordered the troops to stand at ease.07/09/2024, 13:52 Verbs | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/verbs 4/9Imperative mood
This is the mood for expressing urgency, commands, pleas and requests.
The imperative mood is direct. It works well for instructions and where there is limited space,
such as in forms (/node/177).
Be deliberate about the tone the content needs to convey. Imperative commands can seem
blunt, even if you use the word ‘pleaseʼ.
Subjunctive mood
This is the mood for expressing possibility. It shows that something is hypothetical, possible,
conceivable or desirable.
Verbs in the subjunctive mood can work together with other words to express a condition.Was the report tabled in July this year?
Example
Apply now.
Lodge your submission by 31 July.
Verify your corporate credit card.
Example
Please speak up.
Example
If supply were to stop, we wouldnʼt be able to meet demand.
If only they would update the data!
You should apply now.
Example07/09/2024, 13:52 Verbs | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/verbs 5/9The subjunctive mood doesnʼt always need an auxiliary verb to show the mood, only the
main verb. Recommendations can follow this formula.
You can use auxiliary verbs to convey ability, possibility, permission or obligation. This affects
the tone of your writing (/node/40).
These verbs are:
can
could
may
might
will
would
shall
should
must
ought to.If you took a sample, you would have some data.
If you applied now, we could process your application tomorrow.
Example
Recommendations
That the Minister meet with peak body representatives.
Example
This could take some time.
You must submit your application by close of business.07/09/2024, 13:52 Verbs | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/verbs 6/9Phrasal verbs need a preposition or
adverb
Phrasal verbs are verbs paired with one or more prepositions (/node/130). They can also go
with an adverb (/node/127). Check the dictionary entry for the verb to use the correct
combination.
When phrasal verbs need an object, you can put the object between the verb and its other
part.

Parts of sentences (/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/parts-sentences)>Clauses
Clauses
Clauses are building blocks: sentences can have one or more. When theyʼre
well structured, clauses give people clear information.
Clauses contain at least one verb
A clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb.
A clause can be:
a main clause
a subordinate clause – noun, adjectival or adverbial.
A main clause can usually stand alone as a sentence, but a subordinate clause canʼt.
A main clause can stand alone as a
sentence
Every sentence has at least one main clause. The main clause is also known as:
a principal clause
an independent clause.
The main clause has at least one complete (finite) verb and can stand alone as a sentence.07/09/2024, 13:52 Clauses | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/parts-sentences/clauses 1/7A compound sentence contains 2 or more main clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction
(/node/129#coordinating_conjunctions_join_things_of_equal_importance). Each clause has
a complete verb and could stand on its own.
Subordinate clauses depend on the main
clause
A subordinate clause canʼt stand alone as a sentence. Subordinate clauses depend on the
main clause to make sense. This is why they are also called ‘dependent clausesʼ.
Types of subordinate clauses are:
noun clause
adjectival clause
adverbial clause.
Noun clauses
Noun clauses act as nouns (/node/122) in a sentence, even though they may consist of other
types of words. You can replace a noun clause with ‘itʼ and the sentence will still make
sense.Example
We will price the project accurately.
[The entire sentence is a main clause.]
When we know the final cost estimates, we will price the project accurately.
[The main clause is ‘we will price the project accuratelyʼ.]
Example
We will price the project accurately and it will finish on time.
[There are 2 main clauses in this sentence, joined by the coordinating conjunction ‘andʼ.]07/09/2024, 13:52 Clauses | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/parts-sentences/clauses 2/7Noun clauses often start with a:
relative pronoun – such as ‘thatʼ or ‘whoʼ
subordinating conjunction – such as ‘althoughʼ or ‘becauseʼ.
They can also start with a verb in its basic form, which means it has the word ‘toʼ (such as ‘to
sleepʼ, ‘to sitʼ).
Adjectival clauses
An adjectival (or relative) clause acts as an adjective (/node/126). It describes a noun.
Adjectival clauses are usually, but not always, introduced by a relative pronoun (such as
‘thatʼ, ‘whichʼ, ‘whoʼ, ‘whomʼ, ‘whoseʼ).
The sentence should still make sense if you remove the adjectival clause.Example
How you are still working is a mystery. / It is a mystery.
[‘How you are still workingʼ is a noun clause.]
Example
That Canberra winters are cold is well known. / It is well known.
[‘That Canberra winters are coldʼ is a noun clause.]
Example
He learned to Skype. / He learned it.
[‘To Skypeʼ is a noun clause.]
Example
The office, which is in the city, closed for the day. / The office closed for the day.
[‘Which is in the cityʼ is an adjectival clause.]07/09/2024, 13:52 Clauses | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/parts-sentences/clauses 3/7Adverbial clauses
Adverbial clauses stand in for adverbs (/node/127). They describe time, place, manner,
reason, condition, purpose or concession.
The sentence should still make sense if you remove the adverbial clause.
Adverbial clauses are usually, but not always, introduced by:
a relative pronoun – such as ‘thatʼ, ‘whichʼ, ‘whoʼ, ‘whomʼ, ‘whoseʼ
a preposition.This is the committee that met for 12 hours last Tuesday. / This is the committee.
[‘That met for 12 hours last Tuesdayʼ is an adjectival clause.]
The manager, whose staff work hard, often stays back late. / The manager often stays
back late.
[‘Whose staff work hardʼ is an adjectival clause.]
Example
I always eat breakfast before I go to work. / I always eat breakfast.
[‘Before I go to workʼ is an adverbial clause.]
Example
I always check all my emails before I respond.[Adverbial clause of time]
Letʼs meet where there are videoconferencing facilities. [Adverbial clause of place]
She works as well as any other staff member. [Adverbial clause of manner]
Iʼm late for work because I missed the bus. [Adverbial clause of reason]
Iʼll dial into the meeting if the server is working. [Adverbial clause of condition]
Please approve the $20 expense so that I can pay for the stationery. [Adverbial clause of
purpose]07/09/2024, 13:52 Clauses | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/parts-sentences/clauses 4/7In the last example, the comma after the adverbial clause helps users find the subject in the
sentence (‘sheʼ).
In some sentences, the subject isnʼt easy to find without the comma
(/node/109#mark_out_nonessential_information_within_a_sentence).
Conjunctions ‘ifʼ and ‘whetherʼ
‘Ifʼ and ‘whetherʼ are both subordinating conjunctions. They can often be 
interchangeable, particularly in spoken English. Yet they have different meanings. When
youʼre writing, choose the right one:
‘Ifʼ is conditional. It defines a condition that needs to exist for the main clause to be
true.
‘Whetherʼ shows 2 possibilities. Sometimes one of the possibilities can be understood
rather than explicitly mentioned.Although the deadline was almost upon her, she had a rest during the weekend.
[Adverbial clause of concession]
Correct
When I met with Eun-jung, Deng met with Evelyn.
[‘Dengʼ is the subject of the main clause.]
Incorrect
When I met with Eun-jung Deng met with Evelyn.
[The adverbial clause is not marked with a comma, which obscures the main clause.]
Example
We can eat lunch outside if the rain stops.
[The condition for eating lunch outside is that the rain stops.]
We can choose whether to eat lunch outside or inside.
[There are 2 places to eat lunch.]07/09/2024, 13:52 Clauses | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/parts-sentences/clauses 5/7When there are 2 concrete possibilities, using ‘ifʼ instead of ‘whetherʼ can lead to ambiguous
sentences.

Parts of sentences (/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/parts-sentences)>Phrases
Phrases
Phrases are groups of words that add meaning to a sentence. Write and
punctuate them correctly to give people clear and useful information.
Phrases are groups of words with a
specific function
A phrase is a group of words that makes sense on its own but doesnʼt contain a subject and
a verb.
Phrases can only add meaning to a sentence. They canʼt stand on their own.
Types of phrases include:
noun phrases
adverbial phrases
adjectival phrases.
Noun phrases function as nouns
A noun phrase is a group of words that works in a sentence as a noun (/node/122). A noun
phrase always includes a noun. It can also include determiners, adjectives, adverbs and
other nouns.07/09/2024, 13:52 Phrases | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/parts-sentences/phrases 1/6Possessive phrases
A possessive phrase is a particular type of noun phrase. It shows that one noun in the phrase
belongs to another noun in the phrase. Possessive phrases usually have an apostrophe.
Non-possessive and generic phrases
Non-possessive and generic phrases use plural nouns as adjectives. No apostrophes are
needed.Example
Our well-prepared colleague entered the meeting room.
[The phrase ‘our well-prepared colleagueʼ works as the noun in the sentence. This
phrase contains the determiner ‘ourʼ, the adjective ‘well-preparedʼ and the noun
‘colleagueʼ.]
She was well suited to life in an office.
[The phrase ‘life in an officeʼ works as the noun in the sentence. This phrase contains
the noun ‘lifeʼ, the preposition ‘inʼ, the determiner ‘anʼ and the noun ‘officeʼ.]
Example
I thought it was someone elseʼs problem.
[The problem belongs to someone else.]
This was one of the commander-in-chiefʼs first orders to the troops.
[The first orders belong to the commander-in-chief.]
Example
She signed the visitors book.
[The book doesnʼt belong to the visitors. The word ‘visitorsʼ describes the type of book.]

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/parts-sentences/phrases 2/6Adverbial phrases function as adverbs
An adverbial phrase is a group of words that describes a verb, adjective or other adverb
(/node/127).
Adverbial phrases can describe the manner of or reason for a verbʼs action.
Adverbial phrases can also describe time and place. These are known as ‘prepositional
phrasesʼ. Prepositional phrases consist of:
the preposition
any adjectives or determiners that accompany it.[The committee is made up of delegates. The name of the committee relates to the
Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976.]
Example
Grammar rules are quite frequently misunderstood.
[The phrase ‘quite frequentlyʼmodifies the adjective ‘misunderstoodʼ.]
Best of all, we can tick this off the list.
[The phrase ‘best of allʼ modifies the main clause ‘we can tick this off the listʼ.] 
Example
Weʼll do this by the rules. [Adverbial phrase of manner]
We came inside because of the rain. [Adverbial phrase of reason]
Example
Iʼll see you after knock-off time. [Adverbial phrase of time]

An adjectival phrase is a group of words that works as an adjective (/node/126). It modifies a
pronoun, noun or noun phrase.
Adjectival phrases that modify a pronoun, noun or noun phrase can also appear after the
verb ‘to beʼ.
Adjectival phrases can start with a preposition. They are also known as prepositional
phrases.

Punctuation (/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation)>
Punctuation and capitalisation
Punctuation and capitalisation
Punctuation and capitalisation have rules for correct use. Use minimal
punctuation and capitalisation to make content more readable.
Use minimal punctuation to make
meaning clear
Minimal punctuation doesnʼt mean removing all punctuation marks from a sentence. It means
removing unnecessary punctuation.
Only use punctuation that makes the sentence grammatically correct and the meaning clear.
Too much punctuation makes text crowded and difficult to read. If a sentence has a lot of
punctuation marks, it might be a sign that the sentence is too long or complex. Try to rewrite
into shorter, clearer sentences (/node/204).
To use minimal punctuation:
Donʼt add full stops to the ends of headings, page headers, footers or captions.
Donʼt use a semicolon at the end of each item in a bullet list.
Unless each item is a full sentence or the last item in a list, donʼt use a full stop for
items in bullet lists (/node/56).
Donʼt use full stops between letters in an acronym or initialism (/node/190).
Donʼt use a full stop at the end of most abbreviations (/node/184).07/09/2024, 13:52 Punctuation and capitalisation | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/punctuation-and-capitalisation 1/7Minimal punctuation helps users understand your content.
Screen readers work best with minimal
punctuation
Some screen readers will announce punctuation marks. Some will change the modulation of
the voice depending on the punctuation mark.
By default, screen readers that people who are blind or have low vision use, do not usually
announce punctuation. They may pause briefly when they encounter a comma, full stop, or
semicolon. They may also change inflection when they encounter a question mark.
Screen readers usually ignore most other punctuation unless verbosity is set high, or a
person reads character by character.
Watch out for misplaced punctuation: it
can change meaning
Use punctuation marks to:
end sentences (full stops, exclamation marks and question marks)
break up sentences and show the relationship between words and phrases (commas,
colons, semicolons, dashes, forward slashes and ellipses)
show possession and contractions (apostrophes)
connect related words (hyphens and dashes).
Use the correct spacing around
punctuation marks
Check the relevant topic in this manual for advice on how to treat each punctuation mark
(/node/119).
There are different rules for putting spaces around punctuation marks. For example, some
punctuation marks have no spaces around them. Some have a space on either side.07/09/2024, 13:52 Punctuation and capitalisation | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/punctuation-and-capitalisation 2/7Include a single space after a punctuation mark at the end of a sentence. Never use double
spaces. Check each document for double and multiple spaces and delete them.
Capitalise the first word in a sentence
and in headings
Capitalise the first word in a sentence. Use lower case for all other words, unless those
words include proper nouns. This is called ‘sentence caseʼ.
Use sentence case for:
opening quoted speech within a sentence (/node/114)
headings (/node/51).
Do not use all capitals for headings, unless the visual design for the content meets WCAG in
all respects.
Use sentence case with italics for titles of works mentioned in the content (/node/181). This
applies even when the reference is included in a heading within the content.
Minimise capitals for common nouns and
adjectives
Proper nouns generally have an initial capital letter for each word in the noun.
Common nouns and adjectives donʼt use initial capitals, with few exceptions. For example,
adjectives often have capitals when they refer to a national, religious or linguistic group
(/node/133).
Differences between proper and common names
This manual contains guidance for names and terms by topic (/node/117). Always check a
dictionary if in doubt.
Shortened forms
Use shortened forms only when this choice supports plain English (/node/55).07/09/2024, 13:52 Punctuation and capitalisation | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/punctuation-and-capitalisation 3/7Rules for capitalisation and punctuation differ from rules for terms spelt out in full. The
rules depend on where the terms are in the sentence.
The spelt-out form might not need initial capitals, even if an acronym or initialism has them.
Use normal capitalisation practices for proper and common nouns. If in doubt, check a
dictionary.
If the shortened form represents a proper noun, start each word with a capital letter.
If the shortened form represents a common noun, do not begin each word of the full form
with a capital letter.
Only use capitals when the style is standardised or specified in regulations, for symbols of
units of measurement (/node/147).
Follow the guidance on capitals for titles
and government terms
Follow conventions for using capitals for titles, honours and forms of address
(/node/149). Use capitals when an official title precedes the name of the office holder. This
includes titles for executives specified in legislation.
Unless advised in this manual, avoid using capitals in body text for a particular position or
role within an organisation. This practice goes against readability and does not support
clarity.
You do not need to use capitals when the title is an organisational name given to an office
holder. Deference for positions within an organisation might follow house style. Do not use
house style outside of the organisational context. Detail any special use of capitals in a style
sheet (/node/169#a_style_sheet_is_a_useful_tool).Example
‘NSWʼ is written out as ‘New South Walesʼ.
Example
‘EISʼ is written out as ‘environmental impact statementʼ.
‘TBʼ is written out as ‘tuberculosisʼ.07/09/2024, 13:52 Punctuation and capitalisation | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/punctuation-and-capitalisation 4/7Preferences for capitals when the terms ‘traditional ownerʼ, ‘elderʼ and ‘custodianʼ are used
as titles should come directly from the relevant First Nations community
(/node/179#style_for_first_australian_languages_needs_to_recognise_continuing_cultures).
Follow the rules of capitalisation for government terms (/node/136), for example:
government programs and agreements
mentions of parliament
references to states and territories.
Legal material has its own conventions for capitalisation. Content that has a legislative focus
might use complementary sources to the guidance on citing legal material in this manual
(/node/163).
Legal documents often use initial capitals to show terms with a defined meaning (such as
‘Departmentʼ, ‘Scheduleʼ, ‘Vendorʼ and ‘Recipientʼ). In these cases, use the form of the name
as it is written in the legislation.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/punctuation-and-capitalisation 5/7The sixth edition used ‘maximal capitalisationʼ, not ‘title caseʼ. The sixth edition used ‘minimal
capitalisationʼ for ‘sentence caseʼ, which refers to the style for publication titles and headings
in the digital edition.
The digital edition uses ‘minimal capitalisationʼ to refer to a principle, rather than a
capitalisation style. Minimal capitalisation is the principle of writing with the minimum amount
of capitalisation required to make the context understood. It is paired with the principle or
convention of minimal punctuation.
Consistent with the sixth edition, an ‘initial capitalʼ means that the first letter of a word is
capitalised. It is a descriptive phrase, not a capitalisation style. The Content Guide did not
use this phrase.

Punctuation (/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation)>Apostrophes
Apostrophes
Apostrophes show possession and contractions. Donʼt use them in descriptive
phrases or to make nouns and shortened forms plural.
Apostrophes show possession
When the first of 2 consecutive nouns (https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-
punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/nouns) has an apostrophe, it means those nouns
have a relationship. If the first noun in a noun phrase
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/parts-
sentences/phrases#noun_phrases_function_as_nouns) has an apostrophe, it means the
noun is related to the other words in the phrase.
The type of relationship shown by the apostrophe differs, but all are known collectively as
‘possessivesʼ and sometimes as ‘genitivesʼ.
On this page, ‘possessionʼ or ‘possessiveʼ means any relationship between nouns – or
between words in a noun phrase – that is shown by an apostrophe.
Example
This is Ariahʼs desk.
We enjoy Adelaideʼs music festivals.
They are the ministerʼs chief of staff.07/09/2024, 13:52 Apostrophes | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/apostrophes 1/14Follow the possession rules for different
types of nouns
To correctly show possession by using an apostrophe, first ask, ‘Who or what is doing the
possessing?ʼ
The apostrophe goes straight after the noun that is the answer.
There are possession rules for using an apostrophe, according to the type of noun
(/node/122).

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/apostrophes 3/14Descriptive phrases donʼt need an
apostrophe
Some nouns are descriptive rather than possessive. In a descriptive noun phrase, the first
noun modifies the second noun by operating as a definitive adjective
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-
words/adjectives#there_is_a_common_order_for_strings_of_adjectives).
Donʼt use an apostrophe for these nouns.
The first noun is essential to the meaning of the second noun. For this reason, never
separate the nouns in a descriptive phrase.
Only add an apostrophe when showing possession.Example
workers compensation [A type of insurance]
visitors book [A type of book]
drivers licence [A type of licence]
Example
They signed the visitors book. [Descriptive: a type of book]
Her visitorʼs book was lying on the table. [Possessive: the book her visitor owns]
She attended a directors meeting. [Descriptive: a type of meeting]
The directorʼs meetings donʼt have an agenda. [Possessive: the meetings of the
director]
You must hold a valid drivers licence to drive on Australian roads. [Descriptive: a type of
licence]
The officer asked to see the driverʼs licence. [Possessive: the licence owned by the
driver]
Each state and territory has its own regulator to administer workers compensation.
[Descriptive: a type of compensation insurance]07/09/2024, 13:52 Apostrophes | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/apostrophes 4/14In the last 2 examples, the distinction between descriptive and possessive is subtle.
The Style Manual recognises ‘workers compensationʼ in the first example as a descriptive
phrase.
Although not recommended style, we acknowledge that the house styles of some
government agencies require an apostrophe when using the phrase in this way.
Add an apostrophe and ‘sʼ to form
possessive shortened forms
There are 4 types of shortened forms: abbreviations
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/format-writing-and-structure/clear-language-and-writing-
style/plain-language-and-word-choice/abbreviations), contractions
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/format-writing-and-structure/clear-language-and-writing-
style/plain-language-and-word-choice/contractions), acronyms and initialisms
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/format-writing-and-structure/clear-language-and-writing-
style/plain-language-and-word-choice/acronyms-and-initialisms).
Only use shortened forms if users will understand them. Make sure they are appropriate for
your contentʼs context, purpose and tone.
Add an apostrophe and ‘sʼ to show possession for shortened forms
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-
and-phrases).Under the award, our workersʼ compensation for working overtime is time off in lieu.
[Possessive: a form of compensation to workers for doing overtime]
Example
Enjoy hassle-free travel with Tassie's new permit system! [Abbreviation]
The fire destroyed some of ASIOʼs files. [Acronym]
The provisions of the bill are based on the Cthʼs Act. [Contraction]
The review approved ABSʼs work plan. [Initialism]07/09/2024, 13:52 Apostrophes | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/apostrophes 5/14Consider whether the possessive form is necessary or can be replaced by a descriptive
phrase.
Add ‘sʼ to make a plural shortened form – not apostrophe
and ‘sʼ
Add an ‘sʼ to form the plural of shortened forms such as acronyms and initialisms
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/format-writing-and-structure/clear-language-and-writing-
style/plain-language-and-word-choice/acronyms-and-initialisms). Donʼt write an apostrophe
before the ‘sʼ. The same rule applies when making nouns plural
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-
words/nouns#nouns_can_be_singular_or_plural).
Add an apostrophe to plural shortened forms to show possession.Example
ASIO files are stored securely.

We read several US data use agreements.
Consultation with stakeholders is integral to ABS work plans.

Example07/09/2024, 13:52 Apostrophes | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/apostrophes 6/14Donʼt use a possessive when defining a shortened form
Define a shortened form the first time you use it (unless youʼre certain users will understand
it without a definition). Follow the spelt-out term with its shortened form in parentheses.
Avoid using a possessive apostrophe when you do this. It can be difficult to decide where to
put the apostrophe and the sentence is often harder to read.
Use the shortened form rather than the full term if you mention the term again.
Possessive pronouns donʼt need an
apostrophe
Donʼt add an apostrophe to possessive pronouns (https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-
punctuation-and-conventions/types-words/pronouns).
Although the term ‘possessive pronounʼ is commonly used, itʼs more accurate to divide
these pronouns into possessive pronouns and determiners

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/apostrophes 7/14words/determiners) (also called ‘possessive determinersʼ).
If a pronoun appears before the noun, it is a determiner. If a pronoun appears in place of the
noun, it is a possessive pronoun.
Donʼt use an apostrophe for either type of pronoun.
Donʼt use an apostrophe for Australian
place names
Donʼt use an apostrophe for Australian place names
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/node/134) involving possessives.
Donʼt use an apostrophe for periods of
time
Noun phrases about plural time periods donʼt need apostrophes because theyʼre usually
descriptive, not possessive.
In phrases such as ‘6 months retiredʼ or ‘5 months pregnantʼ, the time periods are clearly
adjectival. They donʼt show possession.Example
This is your office. That is theirs. [‘yourʼ is a determiner, ‘theirsʼ is a possessive pronoun]
The fault is ours. [‘oursʼ is a possessive pronoun]
Put the report in its place. [‘itsʼ is a determiner]
It was my idea not yours! [‘myʼ is a determiner, ‘yoursʼ is a possessive pronoun]
Example
Kings Cross
Mrs Macquaries Chair07/09/2024, 13:52 Apostrophes | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/apostrophes 8/14Other noun phrases arenʼt possessive because they are conversational shorthand for an ‘ofʼ
phrase. For example, ‘in 4 days timeʼ is shorthand for ‘in 4 days of timeʼ.
Some styles use an apostrophe to stand for the word ‘ofʼ and don't use it for descriptive
phrases. For many years, the Style Manual has recommended the simple rule of no
apostrophe for either use.
When the time reference is in the singular, use an apostrophe to show that the noun is
singular.
Apostrophes show contractions
Apostrophes show that you have omitted letters in contractions
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/node/191).
Donʼt confuse ‘itʼsʼ (the contraction of ‘it isʼ or ‘it hasʼ) with ‘itsʼ (showing that ‘itʼ owns
something).
If you can divide ‘itʼsʼ into ‘it isʼ or ‘it hasʼ, then you need to use an apostrophe. ‘Itsʼ is a
determiner and doesnʼt have an apostrophe.Example
6 weeks time
3 months wages
Example
a dayʼs work
the yearʼs cycle
Example
I havenʼt seen the report.
Itʼs a busy day at the office.07/09/2024, 13:52 Apostrophes | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/apostrophes 9/14Donʼt use an apostrophe to make a noun
plural
No apostrophe is needed for the plural form of a noun
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-
words/nouns#nouns_can_be_singular_or_plural). This type of error is known as the
‘greengrocerʼs apostropheʼ.
Plural words and phrases that are not usually nouns
Donʼt use an apostrophe for nouns and noun phrases formed by pluralising (and sometimes
hyphenating) words that arenʼt usually nouns. Two examples are ‘whys and whereforesʼ and
‘what-ifsʼ.Example
Itʼs time to give the committee its terms of reference.
Correct
the 2020s
committee reports
newer 747s
fresh avocados
Incorrect
the 2020ʼs
committee reportʼs

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/apostrophes 10/14The Style Manual follows the style for pluralising nouns – no apostrophe. We also prefer to
use the minimal punctuation needed to make meaning clear.
If youʼre unsure, check your preferred dictionary. Many popular phrases appear as entries.
Single letter and digit plurals
Use an apostrophe before the ‘sʼ for plurals of single letters and single-digit numbers. They
are exceptions to the rule of not using an apostrophe for the plural form of a noun.
The apostrophe ensures that letter plurals are easier to understand.
Donʼt italicise these plurals or place them in quotation marks.Write this
The website included a list of dos and donʼts.
No ifs, ands or buts about it!
Ums and ahs littered every speech.
They made their thank-yous then left.
Not this

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/apostrophes 11/14Apostrophes can stand in for sounds
Apostrophes show sounds in words from other languages.
This occurs when words in certain languages are ‘transliteratedʼ, that is, when words in other
languages are written using letters of the English alphabet.
In our examples, the apostrophe is a transliteration of a letter with a diacritic mark that
represents the sound of a glottal stop.
If youʼre unsure whether an apostrophe is needed, consult your dictionary for the preferred
spelling.
Some official names have apostrophes
An apostrophe can form part of the official name of an organisation (or entity)
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/node/88). Use an apostrophe if the organisation does.
To find the spelling an organisation prefers, check its correct name by using reliable sources
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-
terms/organisation-names#check_the_correct_name_of_an_organisation).Example
She was reading the Qurʼan.
Geʼez is an ancient language from Ethiopia.

Brackets and parentheses
Brackets and parentheses
Brackets can help users scan text more easily. Only use brackets if you can
remove the enclosed text and the meaning does not change.
Use brackets for text users can skip over
Brackets can help you break up information. They enclose parts of the sentence that arenʼt
essential to the meaning. Sentences must be grammatically correct if you remove the text in
brackets.
The most commonly used brackets are:
parentheses
square brackets.
Use brackets sparingly for:
non-essential information
shortened forms (/node/92)
references
insertions.
Use brackets only where they make content clearer to people. For example, always use
brackets in author–date citations (/node/165#examples_of_authordate_citations).07/09/2024, 13:52 Brackets and parentheses | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/brackets-and-parentheses 1/8Too many brackets, or badly used brackets, can make a sentence more complex and difficult
to understand. You can usually rewrite a sentence so the content in brackets can be its own
sentence or can even be removed.
Other types of brackets, such as curly brackets and slant brackets, are used in fields such as
mathematics and linguistics. These are specialist uses, so donʼt use them in most content.
Put extra information in parentheses
Information in parentheses is less important than information that is between spaced en
dashes (/node/199) or pairs of commas (/node/109).
Used well, parentheses can improve meaning and make content easy to scan.
Definitions
Parentheses enclose definitions.
Shortened forms
Parentheses introduce a shortened form after it has been spelt out in full. You can then use
the shortened form through the rest of the page or publication.
Cross-references
Parentheses enclose cross-references to other parts of the content.Example
Medicare (Australiaʼs universal health insurance scheme) guarantees all Australians
access to a wide range of health and hospital services.
Example
The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) is responsible for research
funding and health guidelines.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/brackets-and-parentheses 2/8Citations
Parentheses enclose citations in the author–date system of referencing.
Extra detail
Parentheses enclose extra detail.
Clarification and asides
Parentheses enclose text that doesnʼt have a grammatical relationship to the rest of the
sentence. This type of text includes extra information, clarifications and asides.
Avoid using square brackets in
parentheses
Reword the text to avoid square brackets inside of parentheses wherever possible.Australiaʼs population increased by 350,000 people last year (Table 1).
Example
China is Australiaʼs largest trading partner (Smith 2019).
Example
Our 2 biggest exports are iron ore ($61.4 billion) and coal ($60.4 billion).
The winning tenderer (which was a local company) signed the contract on Tuesday.
Example
The department was in a heritage-listed building. (The building was designed by award-
winning architect Enrico Taglietti.)

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/brackets-and-parentheses 3/8Donʼt use sets of parentheses inside each other. Instead, use square brackets if you must
put parenthetical information within parentheses.
Use square brackets to show insertions
in quotes
Use square brackets in quoted material (/node/114) to show that you have:
paraphrased the original content
inserted text that was not in the original content.
You can also use square brackets to clarify quoted material.Example
Australiaʼs Parliament House opened on 9 May 1988. The architects were
Mitchell/Giurgola & Thorp (New York).
Like this

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/brackets-and-parentheses 4/8Square brackets with an italicised ‘sicʼ show that the error in the text is from the original
writer.
Follow normal punctuation rules for
content in brackets
Punctuation in brackets depends on what is inside the brackets. Punctuate content in
brackets as you would if it were outside the brackets.
A comma follows a closing bracket only if you would have used a comma if there were no
brackets.
If the content inside the brackets is a full sentence, include the end punctuation inside the
brackets.Example
The manager reported, ‘Smith was furious with Jackson because he [Smith] wanted all
the credit.ʼ
Example
Written late at night, the report began, ‘The office was previously in Melberne [sic].ʼ
Example
Whitlamʼs comments on the steps of Parliament House (‘Well may we say ...ʼ) are still
widely quoted.
Correct

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/brackets-and-parentheses 5/8Donʼt use brackets to enclose a sentence within a sentence. Rewrite the text instead.
Write brackets in the same type as the
surrounding text
Brackets should be in the same type (roman, italics, bold) as the text around the brackets.
This is regardless of the type of the text inside the brackets.
This is the same rule as for quotation marks (/node/114).Example
The department was in a heritage-listed building. (The building was designed by award-
winning architect Enrico Taglietti.)
Correct
The winning tenderer signed the contract on Tuesday. They were a local company.
The winning tenderer (a local company) signed the contract on Tuesday.

Colons
Colons draw attention to the text that follows. Only add colons that are
essential. Use them to introduce examples, contrasts, lists and block quotes.
Limit colon use
Use a colon only if you are sure it is needed. Incorrect use creates confusion for users.
Introduce examples and contrasts with
colons
Use a colon to:
introduce a word, phrase or clause that provides more detail
introduce a question
give an example
summarise or contrast with what comes before it.
Example
Use correct spelling: check a dictionary if you need to.

Punctuation (/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation)>Commas
Commas
Commas separate parts of a sentence so the meaning is clear. Sentence
structure determines their correct use.
Separate introductory words, phrases
and clauses with a comma
A comma separates introductory words, phrases and clauses from the main clause of the
sentence.
Many introductory phrases can be moved to the end of sentences without changing the
meaning. In these cases, you donʼt need a comma before the phrase. This simpler structure
can be easier to read.
Place a comma after adverbs and other introductory words
Use a comma after introductory words, such as greetings and adverbs, or when addressing
someone. Using an introductory word gives it emphasis.Example
During the meeting, we discussed Item 9.
We discussed Item 9 during the meeting.
Example07/09/2024, 13:53 Commas | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/commas 1/14You donʼt need a comma after an introductory word if the sentence is very short. This
minimises punctuation in very short sentences.
Use a comma after phrases and clauses that change the
whole sentence
Use commas after adverbial phrases (/node/127) and adverbial clauses (/node/127). Adverbs
– such as ‘firstʼ and ‘duringʼ – modify verbs, adjectives and other adverbs.
Conditional clauses are adverbial clauses (for example, beginning with ‘ifʼ, ‘unlessʼ or ‘untilʼ).
They should also have a comma after them if they start the sentence.Yes, they went to the estimates hearing. [Affirmative emphasis]
Goodnight, and good luck. [Greeting]
Actually, that's an interesting point. [Adverb]
Excuse me, should I come with you? [Addressing someone]
Example
Today I went to work.
Example
During the meeting, we discussed item 9. [Adverbial phrase]
Although they were shaking and sweating, the firefighters were relieved to feel the first
drops of a downpour. [Adverbial clause]
Example
Unless the consultation starts early, it will not finish on time. [A conditional adverbial
clause]07/09/2024, 13:53 Commas | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/commas 2/14Avoid beginning a sentence with a string of numbers and
dates
Use a comma after an introductory phrase that ends with a numeral and is immediately
followed by another numeral. It doesnʼt matter how short the sentence is.
Avoid this type of sentence structure because the string of numbers can be confusing.
Mark out non-essential information
within a sentence
Commas isolate information in a sentence when it isnʼt essential to:
meaning
grammatical structure.
Within a sentence, use a pair of commas to separate non-essential or supplementary
information. Always check for the second comma where there should be a pair.
Generally, if you can take out part of the sentence and it is still grammatically correct, it
should be between a pair of commas.
Check carefully. Using comma pairs can completely change the meaning of a sentence.Write this
There were 16.5 million people enrolled to vote in Australian elections on 18 April 2019.
[This structure avoids stringing a number together with a date.]
Not this
On 18 April 2019, 16.5 million people were enrolled to vote in Australian elections.
[This is grammatically correct but less readable.]
Example
The committee, said the secretary, was incompetent. [The committee was incompetent.]07/09/2024, 13:53 Commas | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/commas 3/14Elements that function as supplementary information include:
non-essential clauses
nouns that define the same thing
question tags.
Set off non-essential clauses
Use commas around clauses that add information but arenʼt essential to the meaning of the
sentence.
Donʼt use commas if the clause is essential for meaning.
If you can remove the clause and your sentence means the same thing, itʼs non-essential
and should go between commas.
Non-essential clauses are also called ‘non-restrictiveʼ or ‘non-definingʼ clauses (/node/143).The committee said the secretary was incompetent. [The secretary was incompetent.]
Example
Non-essential
The business report, which the manager had edited, explained the agencyʼs strategy.
[The main message is ‘The business report explained the agencyʼs strategyʼ. The clause
‘which the manager had editedʼ gives more information, adding to the meaning. It
doesnʼt change the meaning.]
Introduced pests, such as varroa mite, threaten Australian honey production.
[All introduced pests threaten honey production. The varroa mite is just an example.]
Essential
The report that the manager had edited explained the agencyʼs strategy.
[The clause ‘that the manager had editedʼ is essential to the meaning because there is
no other information in the sentence to identify what report is being referred to.]
Introduced pests from South Asia threaten Australian honey production.07/09/2024, 13:53 Commas | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/commas 4/14Each of these examples separates a grammatical subject from its verb
(/node/120#a_full_sentence_is_a_complete_idea). This is a problem when the subject is
overburdened with non-essential information.
Check if you can rephrase the information to make it easier to follow. It is easier for people to
read shorter sentences.
Place commas around nouns that define the same thing they
follow
Use a pair of commas when you have 2 noun phrases next to each other that define the
same thing.
You should be able to take out the noun phrase between the comma pair and still have a
grammatically correct sentence.[Only pests from South Asia threaten honey production. Other introduced pests donʼt
affect honey production.]
Write this
The report was tabled last week. It is about demographic changes in rural areas in
Western Australia.
Not this

tabled last week.
Correct
The strike took place in Whyalla, South Australia, in June 2014.
[The noun phrase ‘South Australiaʼ is between 2 commas because it is non-essential
information. ‘South Australiaʼ adds to the meaning but doesnʼt change the meaning.]
Incorrect
The strike took place in Whyalla, South Australia in June 2014.07/09/2024, 13:53 Commas | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/commas 5/14The sentence loses detail without the second noun phrase (Mx Lesley May), but it is still a
full sentence.
Separate questions tagged onto a sentence
Questions can be tagged onto the end of sentences. Use a comma before a question that is
part of the sentence.
Use commas with the phrase ‘for exampleʼ
Generally, use a comma before and after the phrase ‘for exampleʼ in a sentence.
If ‘for exampleʼ begins a sentence, it is an introductory phrase (/node/144). Follow it with a
comma.
If youʼre introducing a bullet list after ‘for exampleʼ, use a colon.Example
My colleague, Mx Lesley May, will exercise my proxy vote.
My colleague will exercise my proxy vote.
Example
Theyʼre not here, are they?
Weʼll be reporting back, wonʼt we?

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/commas 6/14Donʼt use commas with Latin shortened forms
If you use Latin shortened forms (/node/91), such as ‘e.g.ʼ and ‘i.e.ʼ, donʼt follow them with a
comma.
Place commas between principal clauses
joined together with a conjunction
Use commas to connect 2 or more principal clauses
(/node/143#a_principal_clause_can_stand_alone_as_a_sentence) joined by a coordinating
conjunction (/node/129#coordinating_conjunctions_join_things_of_equal_importance)
(‘andʼ, ‘orʼ, ‘butʼ, ‘soʼ).
If they have different subjects, use a comma before the coordinating conjunction.
Do not use this rule to create a sentence of more than 25 words. Shorter sentences are
easier to read.red

The Senate debated the Bill at length, but the party whips eventually called for a vote.07/09/2024, 13:53 Commas | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/commas 7/14If 2 clauses share the same subject, you donʼt need to repeat the subject or insert a comma
before the conjunction.
The exception to this rule is when you have joined more than 2 principal clauses with the
same subject.
Donʼt use commas to ‘spliceʼ sentences
Donʼt use a comma to link 2 stand-alone sentences unless you use a coordinating
conjunction. This kind of error is called a ‘comma spliceʼ.[‘Butʼ is the coordinating conjunction. ‘The Senateʼ and ‘the party whipsʼ are each the
subjects of a principal clause.]
Example
The company closed its Perth office and sacked the chief financial officer.
[‘The companyʼclosed an office and sacked an executive officer. ‘The companyʼ is the
subject of both clauses, joined using ‘andʼ.]
Example
The company closed its Perth office, sacked the chief financial officer, and opened a
branch in Singapore.
[The verbs ‘closedʼ, ‘sackedʼ and ‘openedʼ each complement the same subject: ‘the
companyʼ. Each complement completes a principal clause.]
Correct
The report was finished last week, but the minister has not approved its release.
Incorrect
The report was finished last week, the minister has not approved its release.07/09/2024, 13:53 Commas | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/commas 8/14Punctuate sentence lists and strings of
adjectives
Separate items in lists of nouns or adjectives with commas
Use commas between items in a sentence list. Avoid using a comma before the last item in
the list.
This rule applies to sentence lists and sentence fragments in bullet lists. Do not punctuate
the end of a list item with a comma if it is in a bullet list.
Restrict the use of the Oxford comma
If the last item combines 2 words or phrases with the word ‘andʼ, use a comma before that
final item. This use of the comma is known as the ‘Oxford commaʼ or ‘serial commaʼ.
The Oxford comma can prevent ambiguity in complex sentence lists. For example, use the
Oxford comma before the last item if youʼre using a defining phrase applicable only to that
final item.
A defining phrase is essential to the meaning of the sentence. The following examples show
how the Oxford comma can affect meaning, using the defining phrase ‘for stockfeedʼ.Example
The delegation visited Brisbane, Canberra and Adelaide.
The consultation involved businesses, sole traders and not-for-profits.
The applicant was willing to learn, eager to work and well prepared.
Example
The industries most affected are retail trade, wholesale trade, and accommodation and
food services.
[‘Accommodation and food servicesʼ is listed as a single industry category. It is set off in
the list with an Oxford comma.]
Example07/09/2024, 13:53 Commas | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/commas 9/14Separate adjectives of the same type
When writing strings of adjectives, use a set order – evaluative, descriptive, then definitive
(/node/126#strings_of_adjectives_have_a_naturalsounding_order).
Use commas in strings of adjectives of the same type (for example, a string of descriptive
adjectives).
Donʼt use commas in strings of adjectives of different types.
Use commas in numbers with 4 or more
digits
Numbers with 4 or more digits (starting from 1,000) need a comma. Use commas for
numerals in text and in tables.
You need to use a combination of words and numerals for large rounded numbers over a
million (/node/198). Large rounded numbers are punctuated with a decimal point
(/node/146).The analysis outlined demand for barley, wheat and hay for stockfeed. [All crops are for
stockfeed.]
The analysis outlined demand for barley, wheat, and hay for stockfeed. [Only the hay is
for stockfeed.]
Example
This is an ethical, profitable, efficient organisation. [Descriptive adjectives]
They were a happy, caring, devoted workforce. [Evaluative adjectives]
Example
My new black felt-tip pen splattered ink everywhere.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/commas 10/14Donʼt use a space between the digits, because screen readers can read them as separate
numbers.
When you are using numbers of 1,000 or more, use commas to separate the numerals into
groups of 3 (working right to left).
Commas are not used to the right of a decimal point.
Donʼt use commas in postcodes or dates (/node/140).Example
The total cost of refurbishment was nearly $367,000.
This budget year will see a surplus of $7.1 billion, equal to 0.4 per cent of GDP.

using commas
Introduce directly quoted speech with a comma. Use the comma in combination with
quotation marks.
If an attribution comes after a quotation, use a comma at the end of the quotation and before
the quotation mark (/node/114).
If the quotation is broken into 2 parts, the second part should follow a full stop rather than a
comma.
If the quotation ends the sentence, end it with the original punctuation of the quotation.Example
The year was 2020.
The office was in postcode area 6500.
Example
She said, ‘Itʼs time to start work.ʼ
The Prime Minister said, ‘Iʼm calling a half-Senate election.ʼ

Punctuation (/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation)>Dashes
Dashes
Dashes show a relationship. Generally, en dashes for spans are less accessible
for users than a phrase. Use spaced en dashes to set off non-essential
information in sentences.
Use the correct symbols for en dash and
minus sign
En dashes are half the width of the font height. Use them as a type of punctuation.
Donʼt use an en dash instead of a minus sign. Screen readers will read dashes as dashes, not
as the minus sign.
In Unicode, the en dash is U+2013.
To make sure screen readers read the minus sign, use the mathematical symbol for minus. In
Unicode, this is U+2212.
Donʼt confuse the dash or the minus symbol for a hyphen (/node/105).07/09/2024, 13:53 Dashes | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/dashes 1/16Use a phrase instead of an en dash for
most spans of numbers
En dashes show a span when used with numerals, such as in a financial year, a range of
values or span of time. En dashes sometimes appear in a span of words, such as in a span of
days of the week.
Avoid using an en dash in most content.
Dashes can affect readability unless a user changes their screen readerʼs default settings
(punctuation verbosity settings). Screen readers generally wonʼt read out dashes by default.
This can affect peopleʼs ability to quickly understand spans.
That is why, in general content, itʼs better to use phrases for most spans of numbers. You
can use en dashes in technical content, particularly if it contains a lot of spans.
Spans in general content
Avoid using en dashes for spans in body text and headings. Instead, use the phrases:
‘fromʼ paired with ‘toʼ – for example, ‘from 57 to 65 yearsʼ
‘betweenʼ paired with ‘andʼ – for example, ‘between Monday and Fridayʼ.
Never mix ‘fromʼ or ‘betweenʼ with an en dash.
Correct

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/dashes 2/16Follow exceptions to the general rule
There are exceptions to the rule of using phrases for spans in general content. The
exceptions are for particular date spans and time spans.
Use an en dash for date spans in:
financial years
calendar years
the titles of publications and programs
citations containing a title that has an en dash
terms of office
lifespans (birth and death)
when there is limited space.
Date spans in titles and headings should follow the general rule, except when:
the heading contains a title that has an en dash
using words would push the character count over 70 characters (including spaces).
Only use an en dash for time spans when you have limited space.
Date spans in titles and headings should follow the general rule, except when:
phrases would push the character count over 70 characters (including spaces)
the dash is part of an existing heading or title that you are citing as a reference.
Use an en dash for financial years
For financial years, use 4 digits for the first number and only 2 digits for the second. Join
them with an unspaced en dash. This will not create any issue for users who rely on screen
readers.
Use the phrases ‘financial yearʼ and ‘financial yearsʼ at first mention, unless the context
makes the meaning clear.Annual rainfall between 2017–2019 was lower than the long-term average.07/09/2024, 13:53 Dashes | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/dashes 3/16For financial years that cross centuries, use 4 digits on either side of the en dash.
Use an en dash for calendar years
For calendar years, use 4 digits for the first number and either 4 or 2 digits for the second
number. Join them with an unspaced en dash.
Use the phrases ‘calendar yearʼ and ‘calendar yearsʼ at first mention, unless the context
makes the meaning clear.
Use an en dash for date spans in titles of publications and
programs
Date spans often appear in the titles of government publications and programs. When you
create a title, use 4 digits for the first year and 2 digits for the second year. If you cross the
century, always use 4 digits for both years.Example
The 2019–20 budget [The financial year starting in July 2019 and finishing in June
2020]
The department recently published a list of gifts received by officials during the 2022–
23 financial year. A list of gifts received during 2023–24 will be published in September
2024.
Example
The 1999–2000 budget [The financial year starting in July 1999 and finishing in June
2000]
The department recently published a list of gifts received by officials during the 1999–
2000 financial year. A list of gifts received during 2001–02 will be published in
September 2002.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/dashes 4/16Use 4 digits on both sides of the span for these titles if that is your organisationʼs house
style.
When you refer to an existing title, follow the style that was originally used for year spans.
Reproduce titles with dashes when you cite them as a reference.
Use an en dash for terms of office
A personʼs term of office usually appears in parentheses after the personʼs name. Always use
4 digits for both dates, joined by an unspaced en dash.Example
The diversity strategy 2020–25
The Lake Eyre basin plan 1999–2004

Dates of birth and death usually appear in parentheses after the personʼs name. Always use
4 digits for both dates, joined by an unspaced en dash.
Use an en dash for date spans when space is limited
Follow the general rule and use words for date spans unless you have limited space. This
could be in display text, tables, lists or in social media posts.
Use the following style for en dashes in spans of days and months:
The en dash is spaced when the day and month appear on both sides of the span.
The en dash is unspaced when the month appears only at the end of the span.
Restrict the use of en dashes for date spans in headings
Only use en dashes for date spans in headings when:

Only use an en dash for time spans when space is limited
Follow the general rule and use words for time spans unless you only have limited space.
This could be in display text, tables, lists or in social media posts.
The spacing of the en dash depends on the position of elements in the span.
Use a spaced en dash when:
‘amʼ or ‘pmʼ appears on both sides of the span
the time is in the 24-hour clock format.
Use an unspaced en dash when:
the ‘amʼ or ‘pmʼ appears only at the end of the span

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/dashes 7/16Use an en dash for spans in technical
content
In technical content where there are many numbers, you can use en dashes for number, date
and page spans. Donʼt combine en dashes with ‘fromʼ or ‘toʼ in the spans.
Donʼt use spaces either side of these en dashes if they include a numeral on each side.
Join nouns with en dashes to show equal
relationships
Use en dashes between 2 nouns that both retain their original meaning. These are called
‘coordinate nounsʼ.
When describing something, coordinate nouns can function as adjectives (/node/126).Thursday 18 April 11 15 am – 12 midday

There were 25–30 head of cattle in quarantine in June and 50–60 in July. [Number

Air quality declined during the 2003–2006 reporting period. [Date span]
This same result was reported in Smith and Jones (2020 5–15). [Page span]
Example
The Murray–Darling Basin [The Murray River and the Darling River combine to form the
basin river system.]
A Sydney–Melbourne flight [Sydney and Melbourne combine to form a single travel
route.]07/09/2024, 13:53 Dashes | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/dashes 8/16If you used a hyphen instead, you create a compound noun. These cannot stand in for
coordinate nouns.
If one part of a coordinate noun is made up of more than one word, use a space either side
of the en dash. Otherwise, do not include spaces around en dashes for coordinate nouns.
Rewrite to avoid joining prefixes with an
en dash
A hyphen normally attaches a prefix to an adjectival phrase. An en dash is correct in some
cases, not a hyphen.
If the phrase is not hyphenated, such as in a proper adjectival phrase, you can use an
en dash between the prefix and the first word.
The capitalisation of the proper adjectival phrase and the en dash show that the prefix
applies to all the words.
In these cases, if you can, reword the phrase so that it doesnʼt include the prefix.Example
student-teacher [A compound noun, meaning a teacher who is also a student, uses a
hyphen.]
student–teacher ratio [A coordinate noun, describing the ratio of students to teachers,
uses an en dash.]
Example
Australia  – New Zealand relations [The relationship is between Australia and New
Zealand, not ‘Australiaʼ and ‘Newʼ.]
Example
pre–Cold War policies07/09/2024, 13:53 Dashes | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/dashes 9/16Space en dashes in sentences to set
off non-essential information
Spaced en dashes create a pause in a sentence to add extra meaning, similar to commas
and brackets.
Use them rarely to use them effectively – for example, to draw attention to a new and
important detail for your main idea. As a rule, donʼt make your sentences complex or long
(/node/204). 
En dashes inside a sentence
Spaced en dashes draw attention because they arenʼt as common as other punctuation
marks. They help some people scan content by showing that information is non-essential or
parenthetical.
Spaced en dashes can separate a clarification, an interruption, a correction, a short list or a
summary from the rest of the text.
Always space punctuating en dashes with a single space on either side of the dash. Spaces
allow automatic line breaks in front of or after the dash. 
Often, you need a pair of en dashes.
If the parenthetical information is at the beginning or end of the sentence, you can use one
dash.Example
policies from before the Cold War
Example
Three rivers – the Murray, Darling and Murrumbidgee – were discussed in the report.
Example
There was no time to plan – a shortcoming that would later cost millions.07/09/2024, 13:53 Dashes | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/dashes 10/16Make sure the rest of the sentence makes sense.
If you remove the content between the en dashes, the rest of the sentence must be a
complete sentence.
In a sentence with one en dash, one side of the dash must be a complete sentence.
Em dashes
Em dashes are the same width as the font height.
Various style guides treat dashes differently. Some styles use unspaced em dashes instead
of spaced en dashes.
Both dashes are grammatically correct and can be used to show:
additional, amplifying and parenthetical material
an abrupt change.
Never use both types of dashes for the same purpose.
Spaced en dashes are Australian government style and should be used in digital content.Example
The allies – the USA, Australia and New Zealand – signed the pact in 1951. 
The allies signed the pact in 1951.
Like this
Solar, wind, hydro and tidal power – all are viable options for renewable energy. [‘All are
viable options for renewable energyʼ is a complete sentence.]
Not this
Solar, wind, hydro and tidal power – are viable options for renewable energy. [The
en dash is not correct here. Neither side of the en dash is a complete sentence.]07/09/2024, 13:53 Dashes | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/dashes 11/16Follow this style convention unless a different style reference applies. For example, you
might submit a journal article and need to follow the publisher's style, which uses unspaced
em dashes. Follow one style: apply it throughout.
In Unicode, the em dash is U+2014.
If you are using em dashes in your content, donʼt space them. The spaced em dash creates
too great a gap in text. This is a typographical concern and interrupts reading flow.
An unspaced em dash wonʼt automatically break over a line. This will mean you need to force
a line break on either side of the dash. It can either end or begin a line of text.
Use 2 em dashes for some quoted
speech and deliberate omissions in text
To show a sudden interruption in quotations and reported speech, use 2 em dashes in a row.
The 2 em dashes follow a space.
Ellipses cannot be used for this purpose, as they show the writer has deliberately left out
quoted speech. Read related guidance on ellipses (/node/115).
Two em dashes also show when a name or other information is omitted in body text in
general content. This can be useful when something needs to be withheld for privacy or
other legal reasons, for example.
Use a space if the em dashes replace a whole word, but donʼt include a space between the
dashes and part of the word.Example
‘Any more questions before ⸺ʼ [The double em dashes show an interruption in a
quotation.]
Example
The deed, signed by ⸺, was legally binding.
S⸺ signed the deed in 2017.07/09/2024, 13:53 Dashes | Style Manual

Grammar, punctuation and conventions (/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions)>Ellipses
Ellipses
Ellipses show users that ideas or words are missing from a sentence or a quote.
Donʼt use ellipses to change the intent of the original source.
Show missing words or ideas with
ellipses
The ellipsis (plural ‘ellipsesʼ) is a character of exactly 3 dots.
Use the ellipsis:
if you omit words in quoted text
to mark an unfinished phrase, clause or sentence (/node/120).
If there is an ellipsis in the original text youʼre quoting, add the phrase ‘ellipsis in originalʼ in
square brackets after the quote. Use the same font as the surrounding text.Example
The report is well written, but it needs a thorough review … There is an obvious need for
more work.
Whitlamʼs speech on the steps of Parliament House (‘Well may we say …ʼ) is still widely
quoted.07/09/2024, 13:53 Ellipses | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/ellipses 1/5Donʼt use a full stop, comma or semicolon after an ellipsis.
You can use a question mark or exclamation mark after an ellipsis if necessary.
If a paragraph or more is omitted from a block quotation (/node/114), you can place the
ellipsis on a line of its own.
Do not use a string of full stops
Use the symbol for the ellipsis. Donʼt use a string of full stops. Insert it using:
the unicode character U+2026
the HTML code <&#8230;>
in many software applications, Alt+Ctrl+. or Option;.Example
The minister wrote, ‘The policy settings were … comprehensiveʼ [ellipsis in original].
Example
The review clarified that the Army might have to fight on home ground … To be properly
equipped, the Army needs a new troop carrier.
Example
Iʼve written hundreds of reports: annual reports, white papers …!
Example
The review clarified that the Army might have to fight on home ground.
…
During exercises, ADF personnel were tasked with tracking down enemy troops from the
mythical nation of Musoria.07/09/2024, 13:53 Ellipses | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/ellipses 2/5Add spaces around ellipses
Use a single space before and after each ellipsis.
The exception to this rule is if the quote ends in an exclamation mark or question
mark. Include the final punctuation mark after the ellipsis. Donʼt include a space between the
punctuation and the ellipsis.
Donʼt change the original intent of
quoted material
Use ellipses sparingly. Overusing ellipses can lead to a suspicion that you are misquoting.
Donʼt leave out important details or change the original intent of the quoted material.Correct

Exclamation marks
Exclamation marks
Exclamation marks show emphasis and convey emotion. Only use them in
informal content.
Donʼt use exclamation marks in general
Exclamation marks arenʼt part of government voice (/node/40). Donʼt use exclamation marks
in formal content, such as government reports or briefings.
In general use, exclamation marks can emphasise:
statements
emotions
greetings
commands
rhetorical questions.
Use them sparingly in less formal content such as promotional material and social media
posts. Be aware that exclamation marks can create a sense of panic or stress.Example
That canʼt be true!

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/exclamation-marks 1/4Exclamation marks often appear ‘as themselvesʼ in instructions to users of government
services.
Write one exclamation mark: donʼt
overuse them
Donʼt use exclamation marks too often. Exclamation marks can lose their emphasis if you use
too many.
At the end of each sentence you want to emphasise, use only one exclamation mark.
Some people use multiple exclamation marks in social media (/node/43). This is not suitable
for government content.Like this

Punctuation (/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation)>Forward slashes
Forward slashes
Forward slashes are useful in a small number of situations. Users are familiar
with them in mathematical expressions, dates, web addresses and in some
shortened forms.
Limit the forward slash to specific uses
The forward slash is also known as the ‘solidusʼ or just the ‘slashʼ.
Use forward slashes:
in some shortened forms
in mathematical expressions
to present lines of poetry in body text
instead of ‘perʼ, ‘anʼ or ‘aʼ when abbreviating units of measurement
in web addresses
in dates if you canʼt write them out – for example, in tables
in some place names.
Example
c/- [for ‘care ofʼ in postal addresses]
n/a [for ‘not applicableʼ]
(x + y)/(a + b)07/09/2024, 13:53 Forward slashes | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/forward-slashes 1/5Donʼt add spaces around most forward
slashes
There is no need to include a space on either side of a forward slash.
The exceptions are for:
official dual place names
(/node/134#check_official_place_names_and_style_them_correctly)
lines of poetry in body text – use forward slashes with spaces around them to show the
line breaks.
Print considerations
As far as possible, avoid using forward slashes either side of a line break.
If you must, include the slash before the line break so that the reader anticipates it as
they read the next line.
Write shortened units of measurement
with a forward slash
Donʼt use forward slashes when spelling out units of measurement (/node/147).http://www.abc.net.au/foreign

slash
Donʼt use a forward slash as a replacement for an en dash in financial years.
Write ‘orʼ instead of a slash for
alternatives
When showing alternatives, use ‘orʼ instead of a forward slash. This is easier for people to
understand.
Do not use ‘and/orʼin text. It could mean either ‘andʼ or ‘orʼ, which confuses many users.

Donʼt use a forward slash between words that retain their separate identities. Instead, either
use an en dash or reword the sentence. Forward slashes can make it look like you mean to
show an alternative.

Grammar, punctuation and conventions (/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions)>Full stops
Full stops
Full stops mark the end of sentences which aren't questions or exclamations.
Users need them to scan text and to recognise decimal values.
Complete a sentence with a full stop
Full stops mark the end of a sentence that is not a question or an exclamation.
Following the same rule, use full stops at the end of the last item in alist thatʼs made up of
sentence fragments
(/node/56#lists_can_be_fragments_whole_sentences_and_standalone_items).
Use the final full stop because this type of list is a sentence presented as points to make it
easier to read. Example
The committee met yesterday. It discussed:
office space
working hours
managersʼ salaries.07/09/2024, 13:54 Full stops | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/full-stops 1/6Use full stops with some numbers and
shortened forms
Also use full stops:
as the decimal point in numbers and currency – for example, ‘$3.55ʼ
in numbering subsections and paragraphs in a document – for example, ‘Section 7.3ʼ
in some Latin shortened forms (/node/91) and shortened forms used in referencing
(/node/92).
Donʼt use full stops with contractions (/node/191) or most abbreviations (/node/184).
Donʼt end web or email addresses
with full stops
Do not use a full stop after a web or email address if itʼs part of a sentence fragment or on a
line by itself.
Write full stops in email and web addresses when you use the full form rather than link text
(for example, ‘dfat.gov.auʼ instead of linking ‘the DFAT websiteʼ).
Ensure link text doesnʼt include a full
stop
Use full stops at the end of sentences with link text, but donʼt include the full stop in the link
itself.Example

page headers or footers.
Full stops do not go after:
symbols or units of measurement (/node/147) (unless the symbol or unit is also at the
end of a sentence)
captions and titles (/node/49).
Donʼt add a full stop after hashtags,
emojis or handles

your post ends in:
a web address (URL)
a tag or handle
a hashtag

correctly
In government text messages, use correct punctuation and grammar to avoid ambiguity.
Correct writing shows people that the text is authoritative and trustworthy.
Include a full stop at the end of a text message if it finishes with a sentence. Donʼt include a
full stop if the message ends with a fragment or sign off.

Punctuation (/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation)>Hyphens
Hyphens
Hyphens connect words and prefixes so meaning is clear. Refer to your
organisationʼs preferred dictionary when you are not sure if you need to use a
hyphen for spelling.
Follow hyphenation rules in the
dictionary your organisation uses
Hyphens clarify meaning by connecting words and parts of words into a single unit of
meaning. Use hyphens to avoid ambiguity.
There are few firm rules about using hyphens, and dictionaries do not always agree.
Use the dictionary your organisation recommends and follow its hyphenation practices.
Follow the accepted naming conventions for compass points (/node/135), names of people
(/node/90) and names of places (/node/134).Example
‘a little used officeʼ, but ‘a little-used officeʼ
‘a unionised workforceʼ, but ‘an un-ionised particleʼ07/09/2024, 13:54 Hyphens | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/hyphens 1/17Print considerations
Donʼt break short words over a line, especially:
words of fewer than 6 letters
one-syllable words
2-syllable words.
Break words between syllables so that the hyphen:
is between 2 components of a compound word (for example, ‘data-baseʼ)
is between the base word and the suffix or prefix (for example, ‘neat-nessʼ)
comes before a consonant (for example, write ‘fic-tionʼ not ‘fict-ionʼ) unless this
is misleading (for example, write ‘draw-ingsʼ not ‘dra-wingsʼ).
Donʼt include extra hyphens if you need to break up URLs or email addresses. People
could read them as part of the address.
Use the part of the word before the hyphen to suggest the rest of the word. Consider
the vowels and consonants when breaking words over a line.
Write certain prefixes with a hyphen
Hyphens are useful in some sets of words formed with prefixes such as:
‘anti-ʼ
‘auto-ʼ
‘counter-ʼ
‘extra-ʼ
‘intra-ʼ
‘re-ʼ
‘sub-ʼ.
Theyʼre especially useful for:
doubled-up vowels
clarifying new words that could be confused with existing ones.07/09/2024, 13:54 Hyphens | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/hyphens 2/17A hyphen is used in some words with prefixes to distinguish them from words that would
otherwise look the same.
Sometimes a prefix such as ‘non-ʼ, ‘pre-ʼ or ‘anti-ʼ acts on more than one word. If the phrase
is already hyphenated, use a second hyphen to link the prefix to all words in the phrase.
Doubled-up vowels
Use a hyphen when the last letter of a single-syllable prefix is a vowel and the word that
follows begins with the same vowel.
This practice is less important if a word is well known. Check a dictionary if you are unsure.Example
‘re-cover‘ [cover again], but ‘recover‘ [retrieve or regain]
‘re-creation‘ [create anew], but ‘recreation‘ [leisure-related activity]
‘re-signed‘ [signed again], but ‘resigned‘ [stepped down or acquiescent]
Example
non-English-speaking countries
an anti-harm-minimisation stance
Write this
de-emphasise
pre-eminent
re-enter
Not this
deemphasise
preeminent
reenter07/09/2024, 13:54 Hyphens | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/hyphens 3/17Double letters
Hyphens link a prefix or suffix to a word to avoid a double letter or prevent a
misunderstanding.
Capital letters
Hyphens link a prefix to a word that starts with a capital letter.
Vowel combinations
Donʼt use hyphens if the 2 words end and start with different vowels. The combined word
doesnʼt place the same vowel together.Write this
coordinate
cooperate
Not this
co-ordinate
co-operate
Example
‘multi-itemʼ, but ‘multilateralʼ
‘re-signʼ [sign again], but ‘resignʼ [leave a job]
Example
un-Australian activities
pro-European
Example
prearrange07/09/2024, 13:54 Hyphens | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/hyphens 4/17Use a hyphen, however, if the prefix is attached to a single-syllable word beginning with a
vowel. This punctuation means the vowels arenʼt read as one sound.
Two-syllable prefixes ending in a vowel other than ‘oʼ and followed by another vowel are
often hyphenated. If the base word begins with a consonant, the term is usually written as
one word.
Two-syllable prefixes ending in ‘oʼ are often attached without a hyphen, regardless of what
the base word starts with.
Consonants
Two-syllable prefixes ending in a consonant are rarely followed by a hyphen.reallocate
triennial
Example
de-ice
Example
anti-aircraft, antisocial
semi-official, semicircular
Example
macroeconomics, macrobiotic
monoamine, monocultural
radioactive, radiotherapy
retroactive, retrograde

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/hyphens 5/17‘Co-ʼ and ‘ex-ʼ prefixes
Regardless of whether the rest of the word starts with a vowel:
Many words with the prefix ‘co-ʼ, meaning ‘jointʼ, have hyphens after the ‘coʼ.
All words formed with ‘ex-ʼ, meaning ‘formerʼ, are hyphenated.
Follow the spelling in your preferred dictionary.
Numbers and italics with prefixes
Use a hyphen if a prefix is followed by a number or an expression thatʼs in italics.
Write most suffixes without hyphens
Suffixes are normally attached directly to the base word without any hyphen. The
commonest suffixes include:
-able
-ate
-ation
-fold
-fulinteractive, interrelated
Example
co-author, co-worker
ex-councillor, ex-president
Example
post-1960
the PNG Governmentʼs anti-raskol measures07/09/2024, 13:54 Hyphens | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/hyphens 6/17-ise
-ish
-ly
-ment
-ness
-y.
A hyphen precedes ‘-foldʼ when that suffix is used with a numeral, but not a spelled out
number.
Always use a hyphen with the suffix ‘-oddʼ, whether itʼs with a word or numeral.
Hyphenate some but not all compound
words
A compound word consists of 2 or more words that carry a new meaning when used
together.Example
readable
colourful
costly
Example
300-fold
threefold
Example
There were 150-odd competitors.07/09/2024, 13:54 Hyphens | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/hyphens 7/17Hyphens link elements of compound words as a phrase, but usually only when they are used
before a noun as adjectives (/node/126). Donʼt use hyphens when the phrase is after the
noun in the sentence structure (/node/204).
Donʼt confuse hyphens with dashes (/node/199).
Compound nouns
Compound nouns make up the largest group of compound words. They can be made up of:
a verb and an adverb
a verb and a noun
a noun and a noun
an adjective and a noun.
Most compound nouns donʼt need hyphens because people already understand what the
words mean together.
Verb and adverb combinations
Use a hyphen in compound nouns made up of a verb plus an adverb. This shows that the
adverb is part of the compound rather than modifying other elements of the sentence.
For adverb–verb combinations, you donʼt need a hyphen.Example
‘the up-to-date accountsʼ, but ‘the accounts are up to dateʼ
‘small-business ownersʼ, but ‘owners of small businessesʼ
‘an 11-year-old child, but ‘a child who is 11 years oldʼ
Example
a shake-out
some make-up

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/hyphens 8/17Verb and noun combinations
Only a few compound nouns made up of a verb and a noun need hyphens. The following
table has some examples, but use a dictionary if you are not sure.
Hyphenation rules for compound nouns made up of a verb and noun

Verb with no suffix and
noun (in either order)one word, no hyphen stingray, roadblock
Verb ending in ‘-ingʼ or ‘-

these endings are called
‘inflected verbsʼ. In this
example, the verb ‘flyʼ
becomes ‘flyingʼ, ‘shredʼ
becomes ‘shreddedʼ.Example

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/hyphens 9/17Noun-plus-noun combinations
Use of hyphens in noun-plus-noun compounds varies, even from dictionary to dictionary.
These types usually have hyphens:
expressions in which each element has equal status, which describe one thing
expressions in which the elements rhyme
noun compounds involving prepositional phrases.
Adjective plus noun combination
Compound nouns consisting of an adjective followed by a noun are usually written as 2
words.
Compound adjectives
Compound adjectives need hyphens if they are made up of either:
2 adjectives
a noun and an adjective.Example
owner-driver, city-state
hocus-pocus
editor-at-large, mother-in-law
Example
red tape
free will
Example
bitter-sweet, icy-cold, red-hot [Two adjectives]
accident-prone, colour-blind, disease-free [Noun plus adjective]07/09/2024, 13:54 Hyphens | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/hyphens 10/17It doesnʼt matter whether the compound adjective comes before or after the noun itʼs
describing.
Hyphenate adjectival compounds made up of adverbial phrases when they come before the
nouns, but not after.
Donʼt hyphenate adverbial phrases when they play an adverbial role.
Never use a hyphen for a compound modified by words such as ‘veryʼ, ‘particularlyʼ, ‘leastʼ or
‘mostʼ.
Sometimes, you might need to use a hyphen for clarification.
Set phrasesExample
It was a dusk-to-dawn curfew. [The curfew lasted from dusk to dawn.]
Example
a newly discovered plant species
a happily married couple
Example
a very well known diplomat
a better known
a particularly diligent team member
the most advanced students
Example
The parents lobbied for more experienced staff. [Parents were asking for more staff who
were also experienced.]
The parents lobbied for more-experienced staff. [Parents were asking for staff who were
more experienced to replace the less experienced staff.]07/09/2024, 13:54 Hyphens | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/hyphens 11/17Compound adjectives that are set phrases consisting of a noun plus a noun or an adjective
plus a noun are not usually hyphenated.
If the phrase is further modified, use a hyphen to prevent ambiguity.
Adjectives with verbs
Compound adjectives with present or past participles usually have a hyphen. Some of these
well-established compounds are single words. They will be listed in a dictionary.
Hyphenate compound adjectives consisting of a participle or an adjective.Example
a tax office ruling
the stock exchange report
an equal opportunity employer
Example
a retrospective tax-office ruling
the Tokyo stock-exchange report
a renowned equal-opportunity employer
Example
a government-owned facility
a heart-rending image

a well-known book07/09/2024, 13:54 Hyphens | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/hyphens 12/17Donʼt hyphenate a compound adjective made up of an adverb–verb combination if the
adverb ends in ‘-lyʼ.
Numbers and fractions
Use hyphens for compound adjectives involving numerals, spelt-out numbers (/node/198)
and ordinal numbers (/node/162).
If you need to write out numbers as words rather than numerals, use hyphens to link
numbers from 21 to 99.
Hyphens link parts of a fraction (/node/146).a fast-flowing river
Example
an elegantly executed manoeuvre
a finely honed argument
Example
a 4-part series
a 21-gun salute
a third-storey office
Example

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/hyphens 13/17Capitals, italics and quotation marks
Compound adjectives containing capital letters, italics or quotation marks are not usually
hyphenated.
Compound verbs
Hyphenate compound verbs made up of an adjective plus a noun or a noun plus a verb.
Donʼt hyphenate compound verbs made up of an adverb plus a verb. Write them as one
word.
Compound adverbs
Write compound adverbs as one word.‘one-quarterʼ, but ‘a quarterʼ
Example
a High Court decision
an in situ inspection
a ‘do or dieʼ attitude
Example

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/hyphens 14/17Repeat words instead of using a hanging
hyphen
Hanging (or floating) hyphens connect 2 words to a base word or a number that they share.
This can be difficult to follow, so it's clearer to repeat the words.
Donʼt hyphenate ‘-ingʼ and ‘-edʼ verbs or
most ‘-lyʼ adverbs
Donʼt use a hyphen in most compounds consisting of an adverb (/node/127) ending in ‘-lyʼ

Question marks
Question marks
Users expect direct questions and requests to end with a question mark.
Indirect questions, commands and rhetorical questions can take other
punctuation.
Question marks usually go after the last
letter in a sentence
Like other punctuation marks, question marks stay with the text they refer to. Usually, this is
immediately after the last letter of the last word of the sentence.
Brackets and quotation marks change the position of
question marks
For brackets and quotation marks, place the question mark:
before a closing bracket or quotation mark if the question is part of the text in the
brackets or quotation marks
after the closing bracket or quotation mark if the question is part of the surrounding
text.
Example
Question mark before the closing bracket or quote
She asked, ‘Is the report due on Tuesday?ʼ07/09/2024, 13:54 Question marks | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/question-marks 1/6Inserted question marks can show uncertainty
Question marks can express doubt and uncertainty about dates or other specific details.
Direct questions and requests end in a
question mark
Direct questions end with a question mark. Most begin with one of these words:
‘whoʼ, whatʼ, ‘whenʼ, ‘whereʼ, ‘whyʼ, howʼ, ‘whichʼ, ‘whoseʼ
‘areʼ, ‘isʼ, ‘wasʼ, ‘wereʼ
‘hasʼ, haveʼ
‘didʼ, ‘doʼ, ‘doesʼ
‘canʼ, ‘willʼ, ‘couldʼ, ‘wouldʼ, ‘shouldʼ, ‘mightʼ.
These types of questions are called interrogative sentences.They decided (and why wouldnʼt they?) to cancel the program.
Question mark after the closing bracket or quote
What did she mean by ‘the report is due ASAPʼ?
Did they decide to cancel the program (the EDTA program)?
Example
John Limeburner (?1743–1785) was a convict who arrived in Australia on the First Fleet.
Pery Baylee (1784–?) was commandant of Macquarie Harbour penal station in Van
Diemenʼs Land from 1831 to 1833.
Example
Who will attend the meeting next week?
Whose turn is it to take the minutes?
Are you ready to start the meeting?07/09/2024, 13:54 Question marks | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/question-marks 2/6Some sentences donʼt start with one of the words such as ‘whoʼ, ‘couldʼ and ‘doesʼ but still
end with a question mark.
Sometimes questions are tagged on to the end of another clause.
Requests are often framed as questions. Requests suggest that people have the option of
saying ‘noʼ.
Indirect questions and commands donʼt
use a question mark
Indirect questions donʼt end with question marks, even if they include a word such as ‘whoʼ
or ‘doesʼ.Have they finished voting?
Did you attend the meeting?
Will the new government deliver a budget surplus?
Could you please make your changes by tomorrow?
Example
Thatʼs your proposal?
Example
They would say that, wouldnʼt they?
Example

Can you please upload your edits?07/09/2024, 13:54 Question marks | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/question-marks 3/6Indirect questions are often used in headings.
To turn indirect questions into direct questions you can:
rearrange the words so the verb comes before the subject
introduce a word such as ‘canʼ or ‘whyʼ – but make sure there is a subject.
Guidance in this manual recommends to avoid questions as headings
(/node/51#write_headings_that_are_clear_and_short), except for Easy Read materials
(/node/63).
Spellcheckers often recommend that you change indirect questions to end with a question
mark. This isnʼt always correct. It depends on whether you are asking a question.
Instructions and commands arenʼt framed as questions. They donʼt start with words such as
‘whatʼ, ‘areʼ or ‘doesʼ,and donʼt end with a question mark.
Commands and instructions donʼt suggest that people have a choice.Example
He asked who will attend the meeting next week.
Example
Who we are [Heading]
How to submit a claim [Heading]
Example
Who are we?
How do I submit a claim?
Example
Consider who your future colleagues might be.

mark or exclamation mark
Depending on the context, a rhetorical question can end in a question mark or an
exclamation mark. Exclamation marks add emphasis – this can make a rhetorical question
sound blunt.

Punctuation (/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation)>Quotation marks
Quotation marks
Quotation marks draw attention to words and reference certain kinds of titles.
Write most direct speech in single quote marks. For long quotes, use block
quotes without quotation marks.
Quote direct speech in single
quote marks
Single quotation marks are also known as ‘quote marksʼ, ‘quotesʼ, ‘speech marksʼ or ‘inverted
commasʼ.
Use them to:
show direct speech and the quoted work of other writers
enclose the title of certain works
draw attention to a word youʼre defining.
Double quotation marks arenʼt Australian Government style. Use them only for quotations
within quotations.
Short quotations of direct speech are enclosed in single quotation marks.
Example
‘Yes, thatʼs all that happened,ʼ she replied.07/09/2024, 13:54 Quotation marks | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/quotation-marks 1/11Donʼt use quotation marks for long quotations. Instead, use block quotes.
Quotes within quotes
For quotations within quotations, use double quotation marks inside single ones.
Omissions in direct speech
When quoting direct speech, take great care to be accurate. Writers and publishers have
been sued for inaccurate quotations attributed as direct speech.
If you use ellipses for omitted words, ensure that the omission wonʼt mislead readers about
the content or tone of the source youʼre quoting.
If the quotation needs the information for context, add specific detail in square brackets
(/node/111#square_brackets_can_enclose_extra_information_within_parentheses). You must
be sure that the specific detail is correct and that it retains the meaning intended by the
original speaker.The opposition leader asked, ‘But whereʼs the money going to come from?ʼ
Example
He also wrote, ‘The decisions of the department for “major procurement” were always
political choices.ʼ
Correct
He said, ‘I donʼt agree with the proposal because we need to do more research.ʼ
He said, ‘I donʼt agree with the proposal …ʼ
Incorrect
He said, ‘I donʼt agree with the proposal.ʼ
He said, ‘I … agree with the proposal.ʼ
Example07/09/2024, 13:54 Quotation marks | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/quotation-marks 2/11If you paraphrase omitted material, place the paraphrasing in square brackets.
Errors in quoted material
Quoted material sometimes contains a spelling or grammatical error. 
To show the error is in the original, insert an italicised ‘sicʼ in non-italicised square brackets
after the error. This shows the reader that the error comes from the original.
Non-Australian English quotes
In quoted material use the original spelling of the quoted material, even if it uses US spellings
such as ‘colorʼ. The capitalisation of words must also be the same as in the original.
If the US material uses the US conventions for quotation marks, you can update them to the
Australian convention.‘The [Queensland] government agrees.ʼ
Example
‘They all listened to [the new managerʼs] speech.ʼ
Example
The email read, ‘At the time, the population of Sydney was much higher than Melberne
[sic].ʼ
Example
Australian style
The President said, ‘The Prime Minister told me “No”, so Iʼm working on an updated
plan.ʼ
US style
The President said, “The Prime Minister told me ‘No,ʼ so Iʼm working on an updated
plan.”07/09/2024, 13:54 Quotation marks | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/quotation-marks 3/11Format long quotes as block quotes with
no quotation marks
Quotations that are longer than about 30 words are:
usually indented from the text margin
sometimes set in a smaller font size or a different font.
When they are set like this, they are called‘block quotationsʼ.
Donʼt use quotation marks to identify the quoted material – the formatting does that
instead. Block quotes should also be coded with the HTML <blockquote> element.
To include several paragraphs of quoted speech without the attribution tag, such as in a
media release, use a quotation mark:
at the beginning of each paragraph
at the end of the last paragraph only.Example
As Templeton (2019) writes:
According to the ACT Auditor-General, the transport benefits from the
project are projected to be lower than the costs. She noted other benefits
that had been included by the ACT Government to justify the project.
Example
Dr Nicoll said, ‘My experience as a public servant helped me learn how to run
workshops. 
‘My experience also helps me make my workshops practical.ʼ07/09/2024, 13:54 Quotation marks | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/quotation-marks 4/11Write speech in transcripts and plays
with no quotation marks
Quotation marks are unnecessary in transcripts and plays if the name of the speaker comes
before the direct speech.
The same applies for questions and answers (Q&As).
Refer to certain kinds of titles using
quotation marks
When referring to these titles, use quotation marks in references and citations (/node/181):
a chapter in a book or report
an article in a periodical
an essay
a lecture
a poem
a song.Example
Senator MARCELLUS: Look at the latest report. These results arenʼt great.
Dr BERNARDO: Iʼve seen this happen before. It looks like we might be over budget.
Example
Q. Have you ever been convicted of an offence, other than a parking or speeding
offence?
A. No.
Example

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/quotation-marks 5/11Draw attention to words using quotation
marks
You can use quotation marks instead of italics to make words stand out from your sentence.
Examples include:
a technical term on its first mention in a non-technical document
a word or phrase that has been coined or that youʼre using in a specific sense
colloquial words, nicknames, slang, or ironic or humorous words and phrases, in formal
writing.
You donʼt usually need to repeat the quotation marks the next time you use the word. They
might be useful if the next mention is a long way from the first.
Another use of quotation marks is for words introduced by expressions such as ‘titledʼ,
‘markedʼ, ‘the termʼ and ‘defined asʼ.
Keep quoted punctuation marks in the
quote
Punctuation in and after quotation marks depends on the punctuation of the quoted text and
how it is used in the content.contents. It describes how people learn to recognise numbers.
Example
The papers were marked ‘Five Eyes onlyʼ.
Can anyone here define ‘entropionʼ?
The survey used the term ‘companion animalʼ to describe assistance dogs in
workplaces.
He said the new policy was ‘obviously a great successʼ and then explained its many
failings.07/09/2024, 13:54 Quotation marks | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/quotation-marks 6/11If the punctuation mark is part of the quoted text, place the punctuation mark before the
closing quotation mark.
The same rule applies for directly quoted speech followed by the attribution.
If the punctuation mark is part of the sentence outside the quoted text, it follows the closing
quotation mark.
Quoted material can appear as parenthetical information, enclosed in parentheses,
(/node/111#parentheses_enclose_extra_information)dashes (/node/199) or commas
(/node/109). In these cases, place the quotation marks inside the sentence punctuation.
If the quotation ends a sentence or is a sentence in its own right, place the final full stop
before the final quotation mark.Example
‘Is it okay to ask a colleague out for a coffee?ʼ I asked the HR section.
He asked, ‘Has it arrived?ʼ
Example
‘It has arrived,ʼ said the manager.
‘Has it arrived?ʼ asked the manager.
Example
She said that it was ‘time to start workʼ.
Many things have been called ‘the new blackʼ, but they usually fade to grey.
Did the complainant at any time ask you to ‘Please turn down the noiseʼ?

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/quotation-marks 7/11Sometimes, there are 2 punctuation marks – one for the quotation and one for the sentence.
Decide which is stronger and use it. Donʼt use both punctuation marks.
The surrounding text determines the font (roman, italic, or bold) of the quotation marks. If
the content inside the quotation marks is in italics, but the sentence is in roman, use roman
for the quotation marks.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/quotation-marks 8/11The sixth edition recommended the comma be placed outside the quotation mark, before the
expression. The digital edition recommends the comma be placed inside the quotation mark:
the quotation mark comes directly before the expression.
The Content Guide had advice on the use of single and double quotation marks, with which
the digital edition is consistent.

Semicolons
Semicolons
Semicolons link sentences. They complicate sentences for users if overused.
Do not use them at the end of bullet and numbered list items.
Avoid using a semicolon to link
sentences
Short, simple sentences are easier to read. Overusing semicolons makes writing more
difficult to understand.
Semicolons can create a break that is stronger than a comma but weaker than a full stop.
They can link 2 sentences that share or develop an idea. The information must be closely
related.
Instead of a semicolon, itʼs usually best to use either:
a full stop followed by a new sentence
a comma before the last item, followed by a conjunction (/node/129).Example
He wrote a report for each group. The red report was for one group; the blue report was
for the other.
Sometimes itʼs optional; sometimes itʼs compulsory.07/09/2024, 13:54 Semicolons | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/semicolons 1/5Sentences should be in plain language and no longer than 25 words. Donʼt use a semicolon if
all it does is make your sentence longer.
Too much punctuation makes text crowded and difficult to read. If a sentence has a lot of
punctuation marks, it might be a sign that the sentence is too long or complex. Try to rewrite
into shorter, clearer sentences (/node/204).
If you have to use a semicolon, on both sides of the semicolon write full sentences
(/node/120). Other than in some sentence lists, itʼs incorrect to have a sentence fragment on
one side of the semicolon.
Donʼt end bullet and numbered list items
with semicolons
You donʼt need a semicolon at the end of each list item for bullet and numbered lists
(/node/56). It clutters the list and makes it hard to read.Write this
Find out if itʼs optional or compulsory before you start. Ask someone to help you if you
donʼt know the difference.
Not this
Find out if itʼs optional or compulsory before you start; ask someone to help you if you
donʼt know the difference.
Correct
Staff can leave at any time; they donʼt need a work schedule.
Incorrect
Staff can leave at any time; no work schedule.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/semicolons 2/5Separate in-text references with
semicolons
Use a semicolon between each reference when you have more than one in-text reference in
brackets (/node/181).
Use a bullet or numbered list instead of
semicolons in a complex sentence
Complex lists in sentences can be hard to read. If you canʼt use a bullet or numbered list,
separate list items with:
commas if the list is simple, such as a list of single words
semicolons if the list is complex, such as a list of items that already contain commas or
conjunctions.
In complex lists, you need semicolons to show what goes with what.integrity, persistence and good judgement
experience in projects of this type
a sound understanding of interdepartmental relationships.
Not this
The successful applicant will demonstrate:
integrity, persistence and good judgement;
experience in projects of this type; and

Common misspellings and word confusion
Common misspellings and word
confusion
When words sound similar or the same, people can confuse their spelling. If
youʼre not sure about the spelling of a word, check a dictionary.
Check for words that are easily confused
or misspelt
The spelling of some words is variable. Sometimes itʼs difficult to know which spelling or
word to use because:
Australian, American and British English have different ways of spelling a word
a word might sound similar to another, so people can mishear it and write the wrong
word.
Follow one dictionary for consistency and use it to check variable spellings (/node/30).
Choose the right word and spell it

Abbreviations
Abbreviations
Abbreviations are shortened words. They can hinder peopleʼs understanding,
so they have limited uses.
Limit the use of abbreviations
Abbreviations contain the first single letter or first few letters of a word. They donʼt include
the last letter of a word.
Abbreviations are generally not good for readability and can be misunderstood. Avoid using
them in general content where possible.Example
app for ‘appendixʼ
vol for ‘volumeʼ
cont for ‘continuedʼ
p for ‘pageʼ
para for ‘paragraphʼ07/09/2024, 13:54 Abbreviations | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases/abbreviations 1/7Abbreviations are useful in very limited circumstances:
in a table or chart, where space is unavailable for the full form of the word – provide a
note under the table or chart giving the full form
when using ‘contʼ to show continuing text in another part of content (for example, on
another page of a print newsletter) – the full form of the word is more helpful where
space allows.
Semi-formal and informal content uses abbreviations more often. Use abbreviations only
if users will understand what they mean. If thereʼs any doubt, define the abbreviation on first
use.
Avoid using abbreviations in any public-facing content.
Accessibility requirements
Avoid (or explain) unusual words, phrases, idioms and so on.

Acronyms and initialisms
Acronyms and initialisms
Acronyms and initialisms are shortened forms. They replace full names and
special terms in text. Use them only if people recognise and understand them.
Choose acronyms and initialisms people
will recognise
Acronyms comprise the initial letters (and sometimes syllables) of the words in a term and
are pronounced as a word.
Initialisms comprise the initial letters (or sounds) of the words in a term and are pronounced
as letters, not as a word.Example
Qantas
Anzac
TAFE

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases/acronyms-and-initialisms 1/10Some shortened forms are a combination of an initialism and an acronym.
Acronyms and initialisms are common in formal content. If understood by users, they can
make content easier to use. They communicate terms in as few letters as possible to make
content easier and faster to read.
When preparing content for well-established publications, such as professional journals, look
at the author guidelines and examples of the content. This will show whether using acronyms
and initialisms is appropriate and, if so, which shortened forms are used.Example
ABC
GST
NDIS
XML
Example
DFAT
EPIRB
CPAP
JPEG
Example
CSIRO for ‘Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisationʼ
HTML for ‘hypertext markup languageʼ07/09/2024, 13:55 Acronyms and initialisms | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases/acronyms-and-initialisms 2/10Explain acronyms and initialisms to all
users
People unfamiliar with certain terms might not understand their shortened forms. Acronyms
and initialisms might also be misread by screen readers.
To make sure all shortened forms are accessible:
Define them the first time you use them in content (unless youʼre certain all users will
understand them without a definition – consult a dictionary first).
Include them with their spelt-out forms in the glossary. This is particularly important if
the content contains many specialist shortened forms.
Spell out most acronyms on first use
If thereʼs a chance users wonʼt know the meaning of an acronym or initialism, define it at first
mention. Write the term in full first and follow with the acronym or initialism in parentheses.
Use the shortened form rather than the full term for later mentions.
Write well-known acronyms or initialisms first and follow with the full term in parentheses.
You donʼt need to define some acronyms and initialisms on first use. These include:
some place names (NT, ACT)
time of day (am, pm)
some organisational names (BHP, Qantas)
terms that began as acronyms but are now words in their own right (radar, scuba,
sonar).Example
The Department of Social Services(DSS) manages a range of benefits and payments for
eligible Australians. DSS helps support communities through a number of programs and
services.
Example
All living organisms have DNA(deoxyribonucleic acid) within their cells. DNA tells cells
what proteins to make.07/09/2024, 13:55 Acronyms and initialisms | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases/acronyms-and-initialisms 3/10Repeat the full term if the user needs it
If you use the shortened form only a few times in long-form content, consider writing out the
full term more than once.
People could come across the shortened form without reading the text where it is first
defined. For example, a user might click straight to a section that only includes the
shortened form.
Check the correct shortened form for
government organisations
The names of government departments are often shortened, but not always in the same way.
Rather than using acronyms or initialisms, it can be easier for people if you:
spell out the agencyʼs name in full the first time you use it
then use the generic name (‘departmentʼ, ‘agencyʼ, ‘bureauʼ) afterwards.
This is usually more useful to non-specialist users.Example
DVA (Department of Veteransʼ Affairs)
Home Affairs (Department of Home Affairs)
Example
The Bureau of Meteorology prepares Australiaʼs official weather forecasts. The bureau
provides its forecasts on its website.
The Department of Finance is in Canberra. The department supports government
financial management.07/09/2024, 13:55 Acronyms and initialisms | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases/acronyms-and-initialisms 4/10Include a list if content relies on many
acronyms and initialisms
For content with many specialised acronyms and initialisms, provide a glossary – a list of
terms and their meaning that users can refer to.
Include the glossary at the end of the content or on a separate webpage. Use a hyperlink in
the text to help people access the glossary.
You donʼt need to include a glossary if:
there are only a few unfamiliar shortened forms
each one is only in a very limited section of text
each one is spelt out when first mentioned.
Print considerations
The glossary usually appears before the references (with the endmatter).
Donʼt end acronyms and initialisms with
a full stop
Donʼt place a full stop after the acronym or initialism.
The exception is if the shortened form ends a sentence and isnʼt followed by another
punctuation mark.
Example
Will you be attending COAG this month? [No full stop after the acronym]
Iʼm working on a B2B project at the moment. [No full stop after the initialism]
Sheʼs now working in FOI. [A full stop after the initialism that ends the sentence]
Is the company being investigated by ASIC? [No full stop after the acronym because
another punctuation mark ends the sentence]07/09/2024, 13:55 Acronyms and initialisms | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases/acronyms-and-initialisms 5/10Use capitals for most acronyms and
initialisms
Acronyms are usually all capitals, but use lower case for some familiar acronyms
(taser, captcha, laser). Use an initial capital for familiar acronyms that are proper nouns
(Qantas, Anzac).
Initialisms are often all upper case (VOIP, FOI) but there are exceptions (bpm). Consult a
dictionary if youʼre unsure of the capitalisation.
If the acronym or initialism represents common nouns, donʼt begin each word of the full form
with a capital letter.
If the acronym or initialism represents a proper noun, start each word with a capital letter
(excluding words such as ‘ofʼ and ‘andʼ).
Avoid plural and possessive forms on the
first use
Avoid using the plural or possessive of an acronym or initialism when you define it. This
makes it easy for users to recognise the shortened form in later content.Example
EIS for ‘environmental impact statementʼ
TB for ‘tuberculosisʼ
Example
ASIO [Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]
OPC [Office of Parliamentary Counsel]
NSW [New South Wales]
ILSC [Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation]07/09/2024, 13:55 Acronyms and initialisms | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases/acronyms-and-initialisms 6/10Quote acronyms and initialisms the same
way as the speaker
When quoting an exact phrase, write exactly what the speaker said. If they used an acronym
or initialism, quote it. Show the full term in square brackets if users might not recognise the
term or if you havenʼt already explained it.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases/acronyms-and-initialisms 7/10The digital edition lists common shortened forms and provides advice on the limited
circumstances where they could be used and how to punctuate them. 
This is a departure from advice in the sixth edition, which listed ‘thoroughly anglicisedʼ
shortened forms used regularly in publications. It did not explicitly warn against their use.
The Content Guide mentions shortened words and phrases but did not provide detailed
advice. It advised to avoid using Latin shortened forms, in line with the guidance in this
edition of the Style Manual.

Contractions
Contractions
Contractions are shortened words. People will read and understand them
depending on their context. Avoid them in formal content.
Shorten single words and grammatical
phrases with care
Single-word contractions use the first and last letters of a word and sometimes other letters
in between.
Grammatical contractions join 2 words. They use an apostrophe to show that there are
missing letters.Example
Cth for ‘Commonwealthʼ
Dr for ‘Doctorʼ [As a title]
Ltd for ‘Limitedʼ [As a legal status]
Example
arenʼt (are not)07/09/2024, 13:55 Contractions | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases/contractions 1/7Legal documents and many specialist and professional publications use specific
contractions. Look at examples of existing content to see whether you can use grammatical
contractions. Donʼt use them if youʼre unsure.
Avoid using contractions of single words in more formal content such as high-level briefing
and responses to official inquiries. The exceptions are contractions used in formal writing,
such as ‘Drʼ and other titles.
Grammatical contractions are not generally used in formal content. You can use them in less
formal content which aims to create:
a conversational tone (for example, in a newsletter)
a friendly or collaborative tone (for example, in brochures and manuals).
Find out if the user will understand the
contractions
Look at existing agency content to see whether grammatical contractions are appropriate.
If developing a new publication or communication channel, conduct user research
(/node/76). This will help you understand how people respond to grammatical contractions.donʼt (do not)
isnʼt (is not)
itʼs (it is)
Example
The department has not breached its staffing cap.[Formal high-level briefing or a
response to a parliamentary question]
The department hasnʼt breached its staffing cap. [Less formal briefing or other less
formal communications]
We appreciate that the new rules werenʼt advertised widely. Weʼre now contacting
everyone who might be affected. Please donʼt hesitate to contact us if you have any
questions. [Friendly and conversational content for users of a service]07/09/2024, 13:55 Contractions | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases/contractions 2/7Some users might find grammatical contractions difficult to understand. They can add an
extra cognitive load.
Donʼt end contractions with full stops
Donʼt place a full stop after contractions. The exception is when the contraction ends a
sentence and isnʼt followed by another punctuation mark.
Australian practice differs from US English, which adds a full stop after a contraction (for
example, ‘Mr.ʼ, ‘Ltd.ʼ).
Donʼt use an apostrophe to show missing letters in a contraction of a single word (‘Drʼ, ‘Ltdʼ).
Grammatical contractions use only one apostrophe, even if the contraction leaves out letters
from more than one place.
Capitalise contractions in the same way
as the full word
Use the capitalisation that you would use for the uncontracted word. Capitalisation of the
uncontracted word depends on the context.Example
Tempo Australia Ltd hired him last year. [No full stop after the contraction]
He is currently working for Tempo Australia Ltd. [A full stop after the contraction ends
the sentence.]
They said they canʼt! [No full stop after the contraction because another punctuation
mark ends the sentence]
Correct
shanʼt
Incorrect
shaʼnʼt07/09/2024, 13:55 Contractions | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases/contractions 3/7Use the full word at start of the sentence
(except for grammatical contractions)
Write out the contracted term in full unless itʼs a grammatical contraction.
Only use the contraction ‘noʼ with
numerals
The word ‘numberʼ is sometimes substituted with ‘noʼ. This is a contraction of the word
numero. The plural form of the contraction is ‘nosʼ. 
Only use the contraction ‘noʼ when immediately followed by a numeral. In all other instances,
write the word out in full so it isnʼt confused with the negation ‘noʼ.
This contraction is not a standard symbol for numbers expressed as units of measurement
(/node/147).Example
The Cth Games [The contraction ‘Cthʼ is capitalised because it refers to the name of a
sporting event: the Commonwealth Games.]
A cth is a term for a political community. [Here, ‘cthʼ isnʼt capitalised because itʼs
generic.]
Example
Commonwealth resources are available. [The word begins a sentence, so it isnʼt
contracted.]
Donʼt forget your notes for the meeting. [Grammatical contractions can start a
sentence.]

Latin shortened forms
Latin shortened forms
Use English rather than Latin shortened forms, except in some cases. People
will prefer the English equivalent unless the context requires special use.
Avoid using Latin shortened forms in
most content
Use Latin forms only in limited situations – for example:
where thereʼs limited space, such as in tables
in technical and specialist publications that use them.

Unlike other shortened forms, some Latin shortened forms have full stops.
The terms ‘i.e.ʼ and ‘e.g.ʼ need full stops after each letter. This helps screen readers
announce them.
Donʼt follow ‘e.g.ʼ or ‘i.e.ʼ with a comma, regardless of whether you would use a comma in the
sentence.
Use the English words where possible
Rather than using ‘e.g.ʼ or ‘i.e.ʼ write the English words out in full. Write ‘for exampleʼ and ‘that
isʼ instead, particularly in more formal publications.
Like this

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases/latin-shortened-forms 2/5Donʼt use the shortened form for et cetera. Use of ‘etc.ʼ is redundant in a list introduced by
‘for exampleʼ, ‘such asʼ or ‘includingʼ. These expressions show that the list is incomplete.
If you think you need to include ‘etc.ʼ because thereʼs more to say, include these ideas in your
sentence instead.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases/latin-shortened-forms 3/5The digital edition changes the recommendation to use a full stop with the contraction ‘noʼ
for the word ‘numberʼ (from the Latin, numero). This aligns the guidance with the general
rule for shortened forms, and with the principle of minimal punctuation.

Numbers as numerals are generally easier for people to scan. Numbers as
words remain a convention that people expect in some types of content.
Use numerals for 2 and above in text
In text, the general rule is:
Use numerals for ‘2ʼ and above.
Write the numbers ‘zeroʼ and ‘oneʼ in words.
Follow the same rule for writing numbers in headings and subheadings (/node/51). Apply
exceptions to this general rule in specific situations, explained on this page.
The numbers ‘0ʼ and ‘1ʼ are difficult for some users to read. Some typefaces make it difficult
to see the difference between:
the letter ‘Oʼ and numeral ‘0ʼ
the letters ‘Iʼ (capital ‘iʼ), ‘lʼ (lower-case ‘Lʼ) and numeral ‘1ʼ.
In some typefaces, the numeral ‘1ʼ can also be confused with the numeral ‘7ʼ.
Writing ‘zeroʼ and ‘oneʼ helps to ensure all users understand you are referring to the number.07/09/2024, 13:55 Choosing numerals or words | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/choosing-numerals-or-words 1/13Use words for 2 and above in these
specific situations
There are exceptions to the general rule for using numerals in text. 
Use words for numbers when:
starting a sentence
writing a fraction
writing a proper noun that includes a number written as a word
writing a publication title that includes a number written as a word
quoting a figure of speech.
In addition, use words for numbers below 10 for government content that follows journalistic
conventions (for example, media releases).
Starting a sentence with a number
Start sentences with words rather than numerals. If you must use a number at the start of a
sentence, write it out in words.Write this
Only one person agreed to it.
Their aim is zero net emissions by 2050.
They were open to discussing 3 options.
Not this
Only 1 person agreed with it.
Their aim is 0 net emissions by 2050.
They were open to discussing three options.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/choosing-numerals-or-words 2/13It is sometimes better to rearrange the sentence.
Fractions
Write words in general text for fractions (/node/146).
Use fractions when:
an exact number is not important
the user needs only a general idea of the values.
If the exact number and value is important, use decimals instead.
Proper nouns, titles of publications and figures of speech
Write numbers as words if this is how they appear in a name or title.Twelve people from our group went to the rally.
From our group, 12 people went to the rally.
Not this
12 people from our group went to the rally.
Write this
The board received 621 complaints.
Not this
Six hundred and twenty-one complaints were received by the board.
Example
About two-thirds of staff attended last weekʼs meeting.
There were 270 candidates for the Legislative Council, an average of 7.5 candidates per
vacancy.07/09/2024, 13:55 Choosing numerals or words | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/choosing-numerals-or-words 3/13Use words for figures of speech.
Government content and other style conventions
Various style guides treat numbers differently. Media organisations generally use words for
all numbers below 10 (or 11), and use numerals for the rest.
Content of the same type necessarily uses the same style, for example, in media releases.
Check your user research (/node/76). It might show a need to use words for numbers other
than ‘zeroʼ and ‘oneʼ, for example, in:
longer works
print publications containing very few numbers.
Be consistent. Once your style for numerals or words is settled, use the same style
throughout the content or series of publications. 
Write all numbers as numerals in these
specific situations
There are exceptions to using words for ‘zeroʼ and ‘oneʼ.
Write all numbers as numerals:Example
The Treasurer wrote the terms of reference for the Review of the Four Major Banks and
Other Financial Institutions.
Private politics : a study of five political outlooks by Alan Davies
Example
Twoʼs company and threeʼs a crowd.
Letʼs take five.
She felt ten feet tall.07/09/2024, 13:55 Choosing numerals or words | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/choosing-numerals-or-words 4/13in units of measurement
to show mathematical relationships – such as equations and ratios – and for decimals
when you are comparing numbers
in tables and charts
for dates and times
in a series of numbers
in specific contexts – such as steps, instructions, age and school years
in scientific content.
Units of measurement
Always use numerals to report a measurement (unless it is a large rounded number).
Mathematical formats, relationships and comparisons
Always use numerals:
to show mathematical relationships (such as equations and ratios)
in decimal numbers
to compare numbers
in tables, graphs and charts.
Use numerals when writing fractions in specialist content. Otherwise the general rule is
words for fractions (/node/146).
Mathematical relationshipsCorrect

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/choosing-numerals-or-words 5/13Use well-understood conventions to write mathematical relationships (/node/145). Keep
relationships together so they are easily understood. To do this use:
numerals only
the correct operator characters
spacing between numerals and operators
non-breaking spaces.
Decimal numbers
Use decimals when you need to be precise. Always write them as numerals.
Comparisons
Compare numerals, not words and numerals. If one number is a decimal, the other must be a
decimal and so on.Example
a ratio of 7 ∶1
8 + 1 = 9
Example
They had 8.5 full-time equivalent staff in the section.
Innisfail averages 3,547.8 mm of rainfall per year.
Write this
For those aged 75 to 84, the rate was 2.5 times as high as the rate for the control group.
This fell to 1.1 times as high for those aged 85 and over.
Not this
For those aged 75 to 84, the rate was over twice as high as the rate for the control
group. This fell to 1.1 times as high for those aged 85 and over.07/09/2024, 13:55 Choosing numerals or words | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/choosing-numerals-or-words 6/13Comparisons are sometimes hard for people, so make them clear. It may seem obvious, but
comparisons are only useful if like is compared with like.
Tables, graphs and charts
Lists or blocks of data must consist of numerals, or people will find them hard to understand.
Always use numerals in graphs, charts and tables (/node/45). Numerals save space and help
people scan, find and compare values quickly.
Restrict data to key indicators and results. Keep the presentation of data as simple as
possible, and use consistent units and magnitudes.
Date and times
Always use numerals for dates and time (/node/140).
Series of numbers
In any document that contains a lot of numbers, it is always better to write numbers as
numerals.
Always use numerals for:
a related group of items
a discussion of statistics.
This is regardless of the size of the numbers involved.Example
Wednesday 1 April 2020
She took the call at 1 pm.
Example
The anthology includes 160 poems by 22 poets – 14 of whom were born in Australia, 4 in
New Zealand, 3 in England and 1 in Austria.
The number of internet subscribers increased by 3.6%. Fibre connections grew by
22.4% and fibre growth for the year to June was 69.8%.07/09/2024, 13:55 Choosing numerals or words | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/choosing-numerals-or-words 7/13If you have two series of numbers, for the sake of clarity you can use words for one series
and numerals for the other.
Lists of steps and instructions
Lists, points and instructions are easier to follow if written as numerals.
Age and school years
Always use numerals for age and school years.
In scientific content
You can use powers of 10 for large numbers in technical content, such as science and
engineering publications. Donʼt use powers of 10 in general content.Example
Of the mothers of the 23 sets of triplets registered during the year, 8 had no previous
children, 8 had one child and 7 had two previous children. 
[The first series uses numerals to break down the total number of triplets according to
groups of mothers. The second series uses words for the number of children each group
of mothers had already had.]
Example
1. Write a list
In point 2 of the record of discussion ...
Step 3: insert the audio cable into the left audio jack.
Example
They're a close-knit group of 12-year-olds.
The siblings are in year 1 and year 5.
Example07/09/2024, 13:55 Choosing numerals or words | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/choosing-numerals-or-words 8/13Use commas in numbers with 4 or more
digits
Numbers from 1,000 need a comma (https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-
and-conventions/punctuation-and-capitalisation/commas). Separate the digits into groups
of 3 (working from right to left).
Donʼt use a space or non-breaking space instead of a comma. This is because screen
readers can announce spaced digits as separate numbers.
Combine numerals and words for
large rounded numbers
Numbers up to one million are easy to read as numerals. When youʼre using rounded
numbers of 1,000 or more, use commas to separate numerals into groups of 3
(/node/109) (working right to left). 2.5 × 10 is the same as 2,500,0006
Example
1,750
25,690
745,902,350
Correct
The government awards 2,500 grants to community projects annually.
Incorrect
The government awards 2 500 grants to community projects annually.07/09/2024, 13:55 Choosing numerals or words | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/choosing-numerals-or-words 9/13Use a combination of numerals and words for large numbers over a million when they are
rounded. It is easier to read ‘2.5 millionʼ than ‘2,500,000ʼ.
Billions, trillions and quadrillions:
billion = 1,000 million (10)
trillion = million × million (10)
quadrillion = thousand × million × million (10).
Choose between numerals or words for
currency
Use numerals and symbols for amounts of money (currency).
However, money can be written entirely in words for approximations and figures of speech.Example
The budget allocated $50 billion to that initiative.
The organisation announced $3 trillion in superannuation savings.

Example
They self-declared a $0 turnover.

Currency
Currency
Use the correct numbers, words and symbols for currency so people are clear
about the amount.
Quantify an amount of money with a
symbol and numeral
Write amounts using the relevant currency symbol followed by numerals. Donʼt put a space
between the currency symbol and the numerals.
For an amount less than $1, you can write it either as a whole number of cents or as a
decimal value (/node/146#use_0_before_a_decimal_point_for_values_less_than_one).
For the cents form:
Use the letter ‘cʼ for cents after the numerals.
Donʼt add a space between the numerals and the ‘cʼ.
Donʼt use a full stop after the ‘cʼ unless itʼs at the end of a sentence.Example
$27.9907/09/2024, 13:55 Currency | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/currency 1/7If the amount is a decimal number, always use 2 digits after the decimal point.
If the amount is less than 10 cents, use a zero before the number of cents.
Clarify when you are using Australian
dollars
Where content is clearly only referencing Australian dollars, use ‘$ʼ.
If users could be confused about the currency being referenced, place ‘Aʼ before the ‘$ʼ.
Donʼt insert a space between them.Example
$0.50
50c
Example
$0.80
$0.78
Correct
$0.04
Incorrect

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/currency 2/7Reference non-Australian currencies for
accessibility
Non-Australian currency symbols may be inaccessible to people who access content using
screen readers. Screen readers may be unable to interpret and describe the symbols. Avoid
the use of non-Australian currency symbols where possible.
Options for referencing non-Australian currencies
Use the 3-letter International Bank Account Number (IBAN) currency codes
(https://www.iban.com/currency-codes) – for example, THB, USD, VND. This is the preferred
method because it doesnʼt use symbols and makes content more accessible.
When referencing ‘dollarʼ currencies, use a country prefix followed by the ‘$ʼ symbol – for
example, A$, C$, NZ$, US$. If there is any chance of confusion, use the 3-letter IBAN codes.
Use the currency symbol only, for example ‘£ʼ for the British pound, if you have evidence that
it is the best way to meet a user need.
Using IBAN currency codes (preferred)
Use them for all currencies referenced in the content (including Australian dollars).
Donʼt place a space between the IBAN currency code and the numerals.
Use the same number of decimal places for all the currencies you refer to.Example
The minimum wage in Australia is A$19.49 per hour. [Use of ‘Aʼ is appropriate if the
content is intended for users outside Australia.]
The journalist was paid A$89 per hour during her posting in Hong Kong. [Use of ‘Aʼ helps
users understand that the journalist was not paid in Hong Kong dollars].
Example

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/currency 3/7If using foreign currency symbols:
Explain them on first use unless they are very widely known (for example, US$).
Place them before the numerals and donʼt insert a space.
Donʼt also use the IBAN currency code.
Former Australian currency units
Use words rather than symbols for former Australian currency.
Before 14 February 1966, pounds (£), shillings (s) and pence (d) were Australiaʼs units of
currency. Few people would recognise these symbols now, so write them out in full.Australia – AUD19.49 per hour
Thailand – THB313.00 per day
Vanuatu – VUV220.00 per hour
Vietnam – VND4.18 million per month (urban Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City).

The minimum wage in Japan is currently Japanese yen (¥) 901 per hour. It was
previously ¥874 per hour. [The Japanese yen symbol isnʼt very widely known
in Australia, so explain it at first mention unless you're writing for a specialist audience
familiar with the symbol.]
The minimum wage in the United States is currently US$7.25 per hour. [Because US$ is
very widely known, donʼt explain it on first use.]
Not this
The minimum wage in the United States is currently $7.25 USD per hour. [Donʼt use both
the currency symbol and the IBAN currency code. This also applies when writing
Australian dollar amounts.]

‘former Australian poundsʼ or use the symbol ‘A£ʼ.
Quantify large amounts of money
Use the level of precision needed for the content.
Use words for inexact amounts
Use words for amounts of money that are an expression rather than an actual amount.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/currency 5/7The sixth edition gave the option of using a combination of words and numbers for currency
in descriptive and narrative prose.
The Content Guide did not have guidance on the style for currency.

Dates and time
Dates and time
Dates and expressions of time need to be readable and clear, particularly in
content that contains detailed timelines. Write, abbreviate and punctuate dates
and times consistently so people can understand your content. Follow
international and Australian standards to write dates and times for data systems
and international communication.
Follow Australian conventions for dates
There are Australian conventions for writing dates in words and numerals, and in numeric
formats. These conventions include how to sequence elements of the date.
Use numerals and words for dates in most content. Use numeric dates when space is limited
and in content types like tables.
Combine numerals and words for dates
in body text
In Australia, the conventional sequence for dates is ‘day month yearʼ. Use this sequence
when expressing dates in numerals and words.07/09/2024, 13:55 Dates and time | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/dates-and-time 1/35For dates in body text, use numerals for the day and year and spell out the name of the
month. Donʼt include a comma or any other punctuation.
Spell out the name of the day if it is being used, but donʼt include a comma after the day.
The names of months and days start with an initial capital because they are proper nouns
(//www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-
words/nouns#proper_nouns_are_the_names_of_people_and_specific_things”).
Insert a non-breaking space between the day and the month so they stay together on one
line. A non-breaking space means that a line break will split the date before the year.
Keeping the day and month together allows people to identify the information appearing
before the line break as a date.
Donʼt use an ordinal number (https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-
conventions/numbers-and-measurements/ordinal-numbers) (12th, 21st etc.) when writing
dates in body text.Write this

Follow the general rules above when writing incomplete dates. Spell out the month in words
if you need to leave out either the day or the year.
There is an exception to the general rule for writing dates in body text. If you refer to the day
but not the month, use an ordinal number (//www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-
and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/ordinal-numbers).
Donʼt put the ordinal suffix (‘stʼ, ‘ndʼ, ‘rdʼ or ‘thʼ) in superscript. Superscript can cause
problems for people who use screen readers.
If you refer to the year only, use the full numerical year. Donʼt abbreviate it.Write this

space is limited
Only use abbreviations if space is limited – for example, in tables, illustrations, charts and
notes. Ensure that it is obvious to users which days of the week or months you are referring
to.
The standard abbreviations for the days of the week are:
Monday – ‘Monʼ or ‘Mʼ
Tuesday – ‘Tuesʼ (‘Tueʼ) or ‘Tuʼ
Wednesday – ‘Wedʼ or ‘Wʼ
Thursday – 'Thursʼ (‘Thurʼ,‘Thuʼ) or ‘Thʼ
Friday – ‘Friʼ or ‘Fʼ
Saturday – ‘Satʼ or ‘Saʼ
Sunday – ‘Sunʼ or ‘Suʼ.
The abbreviations in parentheses are alternatives for the standard abbreviation they follow.
Only use the alternatives when the context ensures their meaning is clear.
Note: Style Manual lists Monday as the first day of the week. This is consistent with the order
of calendar days in a calendar week as defined in the international standard adopted by
Australia.

Only use the shortest form of days and months – ‘Fʼ, ‘Mʼ, ‘Nʼ and so on – in limited
applications. An example is a time-series chart where the context and order allow users to
understand the difference between each capital letter.
Donʼt use a full stop after shortened days and months. No full stop is the correct Australian
Government style for all abbreviations (//www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-
and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases/abbreviations), acronyms and initialisms
(//www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-
phrases/acronyms-and-initialisms) and contractions (//www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-
punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases/contractions).
Donʼt abbreviate dates in body text
Avoid abbreviated words when writing dates in body text. Words written in full are usually
easier to read and understand.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/dates-and-time 5/35Donʼt write dates as numerals unless
space is limited
Avoid writing dates entirely in numerals for general content. Use numeric dates only when
space is limited (such as in tables).
Numeric dates can be confusing because their order and format differs between countries.
Use Australiaʼs conventional order of ‘day month yearʼ unless you are writing for users in a
country that uses a different style.
Use a forward slash in numeric dates
Separate the numbers in a numeric date with an unspaced forward slash, using the format
‘day/month/yearʼ. This format uses single digits for single-digit days and months.
Numeric dates can have 2-digit elements
You can also use 2 digits for each element.
Only use this style for the year:
in financial data
if it is clear which century you are referring to
if users understand the order of the elements (‘day month yearʼ for Australian users).Write this

Full stops in computer applications
Many computer systems and applications use a full stop in numeric dates. Use 2 digits for
the day and month and 4 digits for the year: ‘dd.mm.yyyyʼ.
Donʼt use an apostrophe for decades
Write decades with an ‘sʼ on the end. Donʼt use an apostrophe (/node/106) to show the
plural.
In more casual writing, you can use expressions such as ‘the eightiesʼ. You can also use an
apostrophe to show the missing numerals in a decade – for example, ‘In the ʼ80s, all my
jackets had shoulder pads.ʼ07/12/20

text
As a general rule, write spans of years in words, using ‘toʼ, ‘from … toʼ or ‘between … andʼ.
Write the years out in full, not as abbreviations.
Donʼt replace the word between the years with an en dash
(//www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation/dashes).
Use en dashes for particular types of
year spans
Government content often includes spans of years. Some year spans are easier to read and
understand if they contain an unspaced en dash rather than words.
This is particularly true in content that contains multiple spans of years. In this case, using en
dashes makes the content easier to scan.
Use an unspaced en dash for a:

Always include the phrases ‘financial yearʼ, ‘financial yearsʼ, ‘calendar yearʼ or ‘calendar

phrase at first mention and just write the year span, without the phrase, in later mentions.
Finally, exercise your judgement. Consider using en dashes for year spans when using words
makes the content harder to read.
Always use unspaced en dashes in spans of years. Donʼt use forward slashes.Example

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/dates-and-time 9/35Use words for spans of days and months
in body text
As a general rule, use ‘from … toʼ and ‘between … andʼ in spans of days and months.
If itʼs appropriate for your content, keep elements of the span together by inserting non-
breaking spaces between them.
When you include a year, insert a non-breaking space between the day and month. A non-
breaking space keeps the day and month together while the line break splits the date before
the year.
Use en dashes for spans of days and
months when space is limited
Only use en dashes for spans of days and months if you have limited space. This could be in
display text, tables, lists or in social media posts.
But also exercise your judgement – consider using en dashes if using words makes the
content harder to read.
The en dash is spaced when the day and month appear on both sides of the span.Example
Parliament is scheduled to sit from 3 to 21 December. [Non-breaking spaces between
‘3ʼ, ‘toʼ, ‘21ʼ and ‘Decemberʼ]
We will do snap inspections between 6 and 8 September. [Non-breaking spaces

Refer to specific days, events and
periods with capitals
Treat specific days, public events and periods in history as proper nouns and use initial
capitals. Use lower case for ‘theʼ and any prepositions (/node/130), unless they are
capitalised as part of a proprietary name.
In body text, use lower case for generic terms like the names of seasons –‘autumnʼ – and
astronomical events such as ‘equinoxʼ and ‘solsticeʼ. Write ‘centuryʼ and ‘centuriesʼ in lower
case.
Holidays and events
Use initial capitals for all institutional holidays, religious days and public events. Follow the
capitalisation of proprietary names.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/dates-and-time 12/35Write ‘World War Iʼ and ‘World War IIʼ with roman numerals.
The accepted way to write most roman numerals is by typing letters of the alphabet. Use a
capital ‘iʼ – I – for the world wars.
The Style Manual acknowledges that the house styles of some government agencies require
the use of the arabic numerals ‘1ʼ and ‘2ʼ. User research will always guide an agencyʼs style
choices. Our recommendation to use roman numerals comes from corpus evidence.
Shortened forms for world wars
In content with many mentions of the world wars, you might decide to use a shortened form.
Write the name of the war out in full the first time you use it. Include the shortened form in
parentheses immediately afterwards and use the shortened form from then on.
Use roman numerals in the shortened form.
Eras and periods
Use initial capitals for the actual name of a geological era or period but not for broad
historical and cultural times.Example
The Second World War (WWII) started in 1939. Many Australians died in WWII.
World War I (WWI) started in 1914. Many Australians enlisted for service in WWI.

Use numerals for times of day
In most documents, numerals give a clearer expression of time. Write times of day using
numerals, especially when you need to convey precise times.
Use a colon between the hours and minutes. The use of a colon as the separator, rather than
a full stop, reflects a shift in contemporary Australian usage.
A colon ensures that the time isnʼt confused with a decimal number.
For example, ‘10.50ʼ can be read as ‘10 and a halfʼ as well as ‘50 minutes past 10ʼ. Screen
reader users will probably hear ‘10.50ʼ as ‘10 point 5ʼ.44 BCE

The initialisms ‘amʼ and ‘pmʼ come from the Latin phrases ante meridiem (before noon) and
post meridiem (after noon).
Write ‘amʼ and ‘pmʼ in lower case. Separate the numbers and the initialism with a non-
breaking space.
Donʼt use ‘amʼ and ‘pmʼ with words that duplicate their meaning, for example ‘morningʼ and
‘afternoonʼ.
You can use 2 zeros to show the full hour, but they arenʼt essential. Use 2 zeros if that is
consistent with other expressions of time in your content, such as in running sheets.

situations, use numerals and the word ‘oʼclockʼ.
The 24-hour clock
Use the 24-hour clock if it helps people understand your content. This is important when
referring to times in these contexts:
travel
certain scientific fields
the armed services
content written for countries using the 24-hour clock.
The 24-hour clock is also useful in content where space is limited. This is because it uses
fewer characters than times with ‘amʼ and ‘pmʼ. For this reason, it is often used in timetables
and schedules.
This system numbers the hours from 00 00 hours (midnight) to 23 59. It always uses at least
4 digits. It can have 6 digits if seconds are included:
The first 2 digits are the hours.
The next 2 digits are the minutes.
The last 2 digits are the seconds, if you include them.
Always use a ‘leading zeroʼ for hours under 10 – for example, write ‘05 30ʼ not ‘5 30ʼ.
Use a colon to separate the hours, minutes and seconds in the 24-hour clock.Not this

Some government agencies that produce technical and scientific content donʼt use a colon
for the 24-hour clock – for example, 2300 and 0430. This is the ‘basic formatʼ used for
international communication.
If space is limited and you use the 24-hour clock in general content, we recommend
inserting a colon for clarity. This is the ‘extended formatʼ used for international
communication.
Time zones
You might need to define which time zone you are referring to.
Time zones are usually written with the 24-hour clock.
The main Australian zones are:

ACDT (Australian Central Daylight saving Time)
AEST (Australian Eastern Standard Time)

LHDT (Lord Howe Daylight Time).
Daylight saving time is not observed in the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western
Australia.
There are also time zones for some Australian external territories.
Coordinated Universal Time
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is a time standard used as the basis for regulating world
timekeeping.
UTC expresses the unadjusted local time at 0° longitude. It is not adjusted for daylight
saving. Local standard time at longitudes around the world is represented by an offset to
UTC.
UTC is based on International Atomic Time (TAI), which is a weighted average of atomic
clocks located around the world, including in Australia. TAI does not take into account
changes in the earthʼs rotation, so leap seconds are occasionally added to UTC.
UTC is the standard and legal reference for times of day in Australia. The UTC(AUS) standard
is maintained by the Australian Governmentʼs National Measurement Institute
(https://www.industry.gov.au/national-measurement-institute).
Time zones are written as positive or negative offsets to UTC.
Write the initialism ‘UTCʼ, followed by ‘+ʼ or ‘−ʼ, followed by the time offset to UTC in 24-hour
system format.Example
The meeting will commence at 15 30 AEDT on 17 November 2022.

Only use en dashes for time spans if you have limited space. This could be in display text,
tables, lists or in social media posts.
But also exercise your judgement – consider using en dashes if using words makes the
content harder to read.
The spacing of the en dash depends on the elements of the span.
Use an unspaced en dash:
if the ‘amʼ or ‘pmʼ appears only at the end of the span
for spans of time in the 24-hour clock format.
Use a spaced en dash:
when ‘amʼ or ‘pmʼ appears on both sides of the span
if ‘noonʼ, ‘middayʼ or ‘midnightʼ appears in the span.
Donʼt combine words and the en dash.Example

duration
When expressing duration (lengths of time) in body text, follow Style Manual rules about
choosing words or numerals (https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-
conventions/numbers-and-measurements/choosing-numerals-or-words).
This means writing the words ‘zeroʼ and ‘oneʼ and using numerals for ‘2ʼ and above. The
rules also say to use the numerals ‘0ʼ and ‘1ʼ in specific situations
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-
measurements/choosing-numerals-or-
words#write_all_numbers_as_numerals_in_these_specific_situations).
For duration, the specific situations are likely to be when:
you compare numbers in a sentence
a sentence contains a series of numbers.
Write the words ‘zeroʼ and ‘oneʼ in sentences that donʼt contain other numerals. Write the
numerals ‘0ʼ and ‘1ʼ in sentences that contain numerals from 2 and above, or where all
numbers show duration.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/dates-and-time 21/35Use fractions written in words if users only need a general idea of values.
Only use decimal numbers if they are the best way to explain what people need to know. But
be aware that some people might not understand the decimalʼs time value. For example,
1.25 hours is 1 hour 15 minutes, not 1 hour 25 minutes.
It is usually better to avoid decimals and include the number and unit of time.
Use shortened forms for units of time
when space is limited
It is usually better to spell out the units that measure time. This is particularly so in general
content. Only use short forms if space is limited and the short forms are easy to identify
correctly.
If you need to abbreviate time, use the following units as shortened forms:
second – s
minute – min
hour – h
day – d
week – wk
month – mo
year – y or yr (Choose one and use it consistently in your document.)I noted faults at these time stamps: 0 minutes 45 seconds, 1 minute 4 seconds and
3 minutes 8 seconds. [Numerals for a series of numbers showing duration]
Example
The session finished about a quarter of an hour early. [Words for a fraction – gives a
general idea of the duration]
I clocked her at 15 minutes and 12 seconds. [Easier to understand than 15.2 minutes]

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/dates-and-time 22/35The International System of Units – SI – is the international standard for measurement. The
unit for second – symbol ‘sʼ – is the SI base unit for time (https://www.bipm.org/en/si-base-
units/second).
Other time measures are not SI units – but ‘minʼ, ‘hʼ and ‘dʼ are used with ‘sʼ and recognised
as legal units of measurement in Australia. They are listed in Schedules 1 and 2 of the
National Measurement Regulations (https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2019C00572).
There are also commonly-used shortened forms for time measures – for example, ‘wkʼ
(week), ‘moʼ (month) and ‘yrʼ or ‘yʼ (year). These are not legal units of time, but are likely to
be understood when used alongside other time units.
If your expression contains one time measure only, insert a non-breaking space between the
number and unit.
Never add an ‘sʼ to show a plural.

Never add an ‘sʼ to show a plural.
Data systems support specific (and usually several) shortened forms for units of time. For
example, hours might be: h, hh, hr, hours, hrs. They might also be case-sensitive or case-
insensitive. You will need to check system specifications.

media), or in a display or presentation context (display text).
We always recommend using minimal punctuation, but exercise your judgement. A comma
between the date and time can make information easier to scan if you haven't used a
preposition like ‘atʼ or ‘onʼ.
You can also use shortened forms for the date. Only do this if you are sure users will
understand what you mean.
Meet standards for data systems and
information interchange
Follow international standards when writing dates and time:
for international communication
to transfer data between systems.They will appear before the committee on Wednesday, 7 August at 3 pm. [There is a
comma between day and date.]

All welcome!07/09/2024, 13:55 Dates and time | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/dates-and-time 26/35The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) develops and publishes the
international standard for dates and time format – the ISO 8601 (https://www.iso.org/iso-
8601-date-and-time-format.html) series.
Australia and New Zealand have adopted the international standard. The Australia – New
Zealand standard is Date and time: representations for information interchange. It is
published as the AS/NZS ISO 8601 series in 2 parts:
Part 1: basic rules
Part 2: extensions
You can purchase copies of ISO 8601 and AS/NZS ISO 8601 from Standards Australia
(https://store.standards.org.au/).
Standards are voluntary
International and Australian – New Zealand standards on dates and time are voluntary.
The standards ensure that data systems and humans can exchange date and time
information internationally and across time zones in a recognised format.
A description of all the dates and times standards is beyond the scope of the Style Manual.
We cover these standards from Part 1: basic rules:
calendar date
ordinal date
local time of day
combined calendar date and local time of day.
We donʼt cover Part 2: extensions.
Basic and extended formats
There are 2 format options for each standard: ‘basic formatʼ and ‘extended formatʼ.
Basic format does not have separators between units of dates and time. Avoid using basic
format in body text. It is easy for computers to read but harder for humans.
Extended format is also for computers, but it includes separators between units to make it
easier for humans to read.07/09/2024, 13:55 Dates and time | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/dates-and-time 27/35We show both formats in our examples.
Calendar date
The standard sets out a descending order of year (4 digits), month (2 digits) and day (2
digits) for a complete representation of calendar date.
The numbers can be unspaced (basic format) or separated by a hyphen (extended format).
ISO format is becoming more common, especially in software.
Ordinal date
Ordinal dates are often used when transferring data between data systems. This is because
they are easy for simple systems to read.
Ordinal dates are not the same as ordinal numbers
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-
measurements/ordinal-numbers).
Ordinal dates have 7 digits:
The first 4 digits represent the year.
The next 3 digits represent the day.
This is the ISO standard. Some older systems might use 2 digits for the year, not 4.
Days are numbered from 1 to 365 (366 for a leap year). For example, 20 September is the
263rd day of the year (264th in a leap year) and its 3 digits are 263.
The ordinal date can be unspaced (basic format) or separated by a hyphen (extended
format).
If you use dates in electronic data transfer, use basic format and donʼt separate the
numbers.Example
20201207 [Calendar date, basic format]
2020-12-07 [Calendar date, extended format]07/09/2024, 13:55 Dates and time | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/dates-and-time 28/35If people, rather than a computer, will read the information, use extended format and insert a
hyphen between the year and day.
Local time of day
The standard for a complete representation of local time of day starts with the letter ‘Tʼ
followed by 2-digit numbers for the hour, minute and second.
The numbers can be unspaced (basic format) or separated by a colon (extended format).
You can omit the ‘Tʼ if thereʼs no possibility of confusion.
A ‘reduced precisionʼ time of 15 minutes after 7 pm in basic format – ‘1915ʼ – can easily be
confused with the calendar year 1915. In these cases, it is better to write time of day as
T1915 (basic format) or 19 15 (extended format).
Note: The format for local time of day doesnʼt allow for daylight saving. The format showing
daylight saving includes the time shift between local time and Coordinated Universal Time.
This is beyond the scope of the Style Manual.Example
Write 7 January 2023 as:
2023007 [The 4-digit form for the year, basic format]
23007 [The 2-digit form for the year, basic format].
Write 31 July 2020 as:
2020-213 [The 4-digit form for the (leap) year, extended format]
20-213 [The 2-digit form for the (leap) year, extended format].
Example
153020 [Local time of day, basic format – 15h 30m 20s, that is 20 seconds after
3 30 pm]
15 30 20 [Local time of day, extended format]07/09/2024, 13:55 Dates and time | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/dates-and-time 29/35Combined date and local time of day
Combine date and local time of day using the style standards set out above.
Always use the letter ‘Tʼ between the date and time.
The basic format for international communication is unspaced. The extended format uses
hyphens for the date and colons for the time of day.
Insert a non-breaking space correctly
You can insert a non-breaking space using the Unicode character U+00A0.
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar in Word.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/dates-and-time 30/35The digital edition changes the punctuation used with expressions of dates and time. There
are no full stops for shortened forms of months and days of the week. This is consistent with
the new general rule for abbreviations (/node/184).
Unlike the sixth edition, but consistent with the Content Guide, the digital edition
recommends using a colon rather than a full stop when expressing times.
The Latin shortened forms, ‘amʼ and ‘pmʼ do not have punctuation. This is consistent with
the sixth edition and the Content Guide.
Consistent with the Content Guide, the digital edition recommends specifying noon or
midnight for 12 oʼclock (instead of using ‘amʼ or ‘pmʼ).
The recommendation to express a date span using a phrase, rather than an en dash, aligns
with the Content Guide.
Like the sixth edition, the digital edition recommends the use of non-breaking spaces
between the day and month in dates. It differs from the sixth edition by recommending the
use of a numeral with centuries. The digital edition recommends 2 acceptable styles for
references to the world wars, while the sixth edition does not have an explicit rule.
The Content Guide illustrated guidance, but did not have explicit advice, on the use of
spacing for dates and time. The use of a space between time and ‘amʼ or ‘pmʼ is consistent
with the sixth edition, but a departure from examples given in the Content Guide.

Fractions and decimals
Fractions and decimals
Decimals are useful when people need a precise value. Fractions are useful
when an exact value is not important.
Choose between a decimal value or
fraction
You can express a less-than-whole number as a decimal or as a fraction.
In text, write decimal values as numerals
(/node/198#write_all_numbers_as_numerals_in_these_specific_situations). Write fractions
as words (/node/198#use_words_for_2_and_above_in_these_specific_situations).
Use decimals when you need to be precise.Example
0.5 [Decimal value]
half [Fraction]
Example
They had 7.5 full-time equivalent staff in the section.07/09/2024, 13:55 Fractions and decimals | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/fractions-and-decimals 1/4Use fractions when:
an exact number is not important
the user needs only a general idea of the values.
Use ‘0ʼ before a decimal point for values
less than one
Decimal values less than one have a ‘0ʼ before the decimal point.
Always use a full stop, not a comma, for the decimal point. This is the style for Australian
content.Australia received 412.8 mm of rainfall this year.
Example
About two-thirds of staff attended last week's meeting.
The dam was three-quarters full.

Mathematical relationships
Mathematical relationships
A mathematical relationship is the connection between sets of numbers or
variables. In most content, the connection should be described in words. Only
use symbols if thereʼs a user need. Code symbols correctly to ensure they are
accessible.
Use words instead of symbols to improve
accessibility
In most content, explain mathematical relationships using words instead of symbols.
Many people will understand simple operations written with symbols (1 + 1 = 2). But other
mathematical relationships are hard to understand unless they are written in words. Symbols
might not be available in every font set and the default settings of screen readers might not
read all symbols.
Remember that some users are unfamiliar with mathematical terminology. Make sure that
you explain terms and concepts in plain language.
This rule applies to general content. If youʼre writing specialist mathematical and scientific
content, follow your publisherʼs style.07/09/2024, 13:55 Mathematical relationships | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/mathematical-relationships 1/16In all mathematical expressions, write numbers as numerals
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-
measurements/choosing-numerals-or-
words#write_all_numbers_as_numerals_in_these_specific_situations). This applies even
when you use words to explain a relationship between the numbers.
Use symbols when user research
supports their use
Only use mathematical symbols in general content if user research shows they are
appropriate for your users and for the type of content.
Complicated mathematical relationships are difficult to express in words and are best written
using symbols. These are more likely to appear in technical content, but user research might
show it is appropriate to reproduce them in general content.
If so, use the following guidance to write and space mathematical symbols correctly.
Use code for symbols, not punctuation
Always use the correct code for mathematical symbols, including:
plus +
minus −
multiplication ×Write this
The square root of 56 is greater than the square root of 26.
We can prove that 0 does not equal 1.
Not this
√56 > √26.
We can prove that 0 ≠ 1.
We can prove that zero does not equal one.07/09/2024, 13:55 Mathematical relationships | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/mathematical-relationships 2/16division ÷
greater than >
less than <
greater than or equal to ≥
less than or equal to ≤.
The +, −, ×, and ÷ symbols are called ‘operatorsʼ because they carry out an operation on 2
elements of a mathematical expression. The >, <, ≥ and ≤ symbols are ‘relationsʼ because
they show a relationship between 2 elements of a mathematical expression.
Donʼt use punctuation marks (such as a dash) instead of a symbol.
Not all the symbols on your keyboard are coded correctly. It is better to insert a symbol using
its Unicode character or Wordʼs Insert>Symbol command.
You will find other codes, such as HTML entities, in the table, ‘Codes for mathematical
symbolsʼ.
Note on terminology
The Style Manual uses ‘symbolʼ rather than ‘signʼ when referring to particular mathematical
symbols. For example, when writing about the symbol ‘+ʼ, we use ‘plus symbolʼ or ‘plusʼ
rather than ‘plus signʼ.
In mathematics, the ‘signʼ of a number generally means whether it is positive or negative.
In non-technical writing however, it is acceptable to use the terms ‘plus signʼ, ‘minus signʼ,
‘multiplication signʼ and so on. ‘Signʼ is commonly used in general content to mean a
mathematical symbol.Correct
8 − 0.5 [Using the Unicode character for minus; type ‘2212ʼ then ‘Alt+xʼ]
Incorrect
8 - 0.5 [Using the hyphen on a keyboard]07/09/2024, 13:55 Mathematical relationships | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/mathematical-relationships 3/16Donʼt use a symbol or a space for ratios
Ratios donʼt use a symbol, unlike mathematical operators. Ratios use a punctuation mark
instead: the colon (/node/104).
Ratios donʼt have a space around the colon.
Accessibility requirements
Mathematical expressions in technical content often contain symbols and superscript.
Superscript is a number, letter or symbol placed above a character, for example, the
‘2ʼ in ‘xʼ.
Unless they are coded correctly, symbols and superscript may be inaccessible for
some people who:
have low vision
use screen readers to access content.
Insert symbols and superscript with tools such as:
Unicode (https://home.unicode.org/)
LaTeX (https://www.latex-project.org/)
Mathematical Markup Language (https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/) (MathML).
These tools make mathematical equations and symbols accessible, including for
screen readers.
Ensure both symbols and superscript can be enlarged without loss of content or
functionality. Donʼt use images of symbols or superscript.
Note on coding: the Style Manual does not use MathML or LaTeX for this page.
Agencies working with a lot of mathematical and scientific content will likely use these
tools. Our aim is to help government writers of general content create accessibleCorrect

Addition and positive numbers
Use the plus symbol (+) on your keyboard; it is coded correctly. You can also use Wordʼs
Insert>Symbol command or Unicode. The Unicode character is U+002B.
To show addition, use non-breaking spaces around the plus symbol.
To show a positive value, write the number after the plus symbol without a space. Here, the
plus symbol is not working as an operator, it is modifying the number.

Use the mathematical symbol for minus (−).
Don't use:
the minus symbol on the numerical keypad
an en dash (–)
a hyphen (-).
In Unicode, the symbol for minus is U+2212.
To show subtraction, use non-breaking spaces around the minus symbol.
To show a negative value, write the number after the minus symbol without a space.
Here, the minus sign is not working as an operator, it is modifying the number.
Division
Use the division symbol (÷) or the division slash ( ⁄  ). People sometimes use the forward
slash (/) to show division as well.
Use non-breaking spaces around the division symbol.
Programming languages and Excel use the forward slash (/) for division.
In most cases, it's best to use the division symbol (÷). The division slash is easily confused
with the forward slash which is also used to show alternatives.Correct
12 − 4 [Subtraction with non-breaking spaces around the minus]
−5 [Negative value with no space after the minus]
Incorrect
12−4 [Subtraction with no non-breaking spaces around the minus]
− 5 [Negative value with non-breaking space after the minus]07/09/2024, 13:55 Mathematical relationships | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/mathematical-relationships 6/16In Unicode, the symbol for division is U+00F7 and the division slash is U+2215.
However, division slashes might appear in expressions you have to reproduce in your content
– for example, in algebraic fractions.
The division slash is unspaced. This is a style convention in mathematics. But consider
adding a narrow no-break space around the division slash to make the expression clearer.
You can also use a thin space, but it will break across lines.
The Unicode characters are:
division symbol – U+00F7
division slash – U+2215
narrow no-break space – U+202F
thin space – U+2009.
Multiplication
Use the mathematical symbol for the multiplication (×). Donʼt use the letter ‘xʼ.
The ‘dot operatorʼ (Unicode U+22C5) is sometimes used to show multiplication in
mathematical expressions – for example ‘x ∙ y ʼ. This is done to avoid confusion in
expressions that contain both the multiplication symbol ‘×ʼ and a letter ‘xʼ used as a variable.
Use the multiplication symbol in general content, not the dot operator. The multiplication
symbol is understood more easily.
Use non-breaking spaces around the multiplication symbol.Example
(a + b) ÷ (x + y) [Division symbol with non-breaking spaces]
(a + b)⁄(x + y) [Division slash, unspaced]
(a + b) ⁄ (x + y) [Division slash with narrow no-break spaces]
(a + b) ⁄ (x + y) [Division slash with thin spaces]
The letters in the examples are called ‘variablesʼ. A variable stands for an unknown
number. Write variables in italics. Do not italicise other elements.07/09/2024, 13:55 Mathematical relationships | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/mathematical-relationships 7/16In Unicode, the symbol for multiplication is U+00D7.
Programming languages and Excel use the asterisk (*) for multiplication. The asterisk has
other meanings in algebra, so only use it for multiplication if users will understand what you
mean.
‘Greater thanʼ and ‘less thanʼ
The ‘greater thanʼ (>) and ‘less thanʼ (<) symbols are relations used to compare values.
The symbols > and < can be confusing. Like all symbols, it is better to use words in general
content. This helps users to understand the mathematical relationship you are writing about.
When research shows that users need the symbols, use non-breaking spaces between the
symbol and numbers.
Use your keyboard to insert these symbols; they are coded correctly. You can also use
Wordʼs Insert>Symbol command or Unicode.
The Unicode characters are:
greater than – U+003E
less than – U+003C.Write this
(a + b) × (x + y) [Multiplication symbol with non-breaking spaces]
Not this
(a + b) · (x + y) [Multiplication dot]
(a + b) * (x + y) [Asterisk]
Example
0.7 is less than 0.9 [General content]
0.7 < 0.9 [Less than symbol with non-breaking spaces]07/09/2024, 13:55 Mathematical relationships | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/mathematical-relationships 8/16‘Greater than or equal toʼ and ‘less than or equal toʼ
The ‘greater than or equal toʼ (≥) and ‘less thanʼ (≤) relations are commonly used in algebra.
When research shows that users need the symbols (and algebraic expressions), use non-
breaking spaces.
Use Wordʼs Insert>Symbol command or Unicode to insert the symbols.
The Unicode characters are:
greater than or equal to – U+2265
less than or equal to – U+2264.
Like all symbols, it is better to use words in general content.
Programming languages use the symbols ‘>=ʼ and ‘<=ʼ for these relationships. Donʼt use
them in your content, they are not mathematical notation.
Donʼt space >,<, ≥ and ≤ when they refer to a range of
numbers
When there is no space between a relation and a number, the expressions shows a range of
numbers. For example, ‘<6.74ʼ refers to an infinitely large set of real numbers less than the
number 6.74.
In most content, it is better to use words to avoid confusion: ‘less than 6.74ʼ.Example
Our customer satisfaction target is ‘greater than or equal to 90 out of 100ʼ. [Words in
general content]
x ≥ 4 [Symbol in an algebraic expression]
Write this
The authors removed an outlier based on a Body Mass Index of less than 13 and greater
than 97.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/mathematical-relationships 9/16Use a non-breaking space to keep
characters and symbols together
Insert a non-breaking space between numbers, letters and the symbol for an operator or a
relation. A non-breaking space means that line breaks wonʼt separate a character from its
symbol.
You can insert a non-breaking space using the Unicode character U+00A0.
In HTML, use the entity &nbsp; to insert a non-breaking space. You can also use the
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar in Word.
Donʼt use a space if a symbol modifies a
value
Symbols that modify a value rather than show an operation or a relationship, do not need a
space.
Non-mathematical terms help to explain this.
When the symbol acts as a mathematical adjective, there is no space between the symbol
and the character it modifies. An example is a positive or negative amount: +3 and −25.
When the symbol acts as a mathematical conjunction or verb, there are non-breaking spaces
around the symbol. Examples are addition 6 + 6 = 12 and expressions that compare values
such as 9 < 16. There are other examples in earlier sections on this page.
To avoid confusion in sentences, it is usually better to use words not symbols.Not this

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/mathematical-relationships 10/16Use the correct style for equations
An equation is a statement or question consisting of 2 mathematical expressions linked by an
equals symbol (=).
Use equations if user research supports their inclusion.
The Unicode character for the equals symbol is U+003D.
Put a non-breaking space around the equals symbol and around all operators except for the
division slash – it is unspaced. If you think the equation is clearer with a space around the
division slash, use a narrow no-break space (U+202F) or thin space (U+2009).
There is no space between a character and its superscript or subscript.Write this
The balance is minus $10.
Not this
The balance is −$10.
Correct
10 + 1 = 11 [Equation with non-breaking spaces around plus and equals]
x × x = x [The index law of multiplication – no space between the variable and

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/mathematical-relationships 11/16Set equations as block quotes
An equation can be set ‘inlineʼ within a line of text or ‘displayedʼ on a line of its own.
Displayed equations are indented, centred or left-aligned.
For general content, the Style Manual recommends using a displayed equation set as a block
quote. Code the block quote with the HTML <blockquote> element.
Donʼt introduce the equation with a colon, but do use other sentence punctuation. For
example, if the equation ends a sentence, follow the equation with a full stop.>
Specialist mathematical publications often contain both inline and displayed equations.
Follow the publisherʼs style if you write specialist content.
When writing mathematical expressions in Word documents, consider using Wordʼs equation
editor (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/write-an-equation-or-formula-1d01cabc-
ceb1-458d-bc70-7f9737722702) (type ‘Alt+=ʼ or Insert>Equation). It has built-in style for
elements such as position, non-breaking spaces, font, sizing, bold, italics and superscript.
The equation editor in the most recent versions of Word also allows you to create and edit
linear format equations (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/linear-format-equations-

Measurement and units
Measurement and units
Standard units of measurement support readability and accuracy. Express
precise values for users by combining numerals with the correct unit symbol.
Use the standard units of measurement
Australia uses the metric system for most quantities:
The modern form of the metric system is the International System of Units
(https://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/ ) (SI).
Australia also uses some non-SI legal units of measurement, which are listed in
Schedules 1 and 2 of the National Measurement Regulations
(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2012C00400).
The National Measurement Institute oversees Australian units of measurement
(https://www.industry.gov.au/regulations-and-standards/australias-measurement-system).
The governing legislation is the National Measurement Act 1960
(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C1960A00064).
Donʼt use the non-SI legal units of measurement for international content. The exception is
when you have checked that users will understand and accept them.
Rules for units of measurement:
Punctuation: donʼt place a full stop after a unit of measurement.07/09/2024, 13:56 Measurement and units | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/measurement-and-units 1/12Capitalisation: use capitals only if the unit represents a proper name.
Plural and possessive: units donʼt have a plural or possessive form.
Start of a sentence: write out the unit in full.
Spacing: use a non-breaking space between the number and the unit.
Accessibility requirements
Measurements and units can include:
symbols (for example, ‘µʼ for ‘microʼ)
superscript (a number, letter or symbol placed above a line – for example, the
‘2ʼ in ‘km2ʼ).
Unless they are coded correctly, symbols and superscript may be inaccessible for
some people who:
have low vision
use screen readers to access content.
Insert symbols and superscript with tools such as:
Unicode (https://home.unicode.org/)
LaTeX (https://www.latex-project.org/)
Mathematical Markup Language (https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/) (MathML).
These tools make mathematical equations and symbols accessible, including for
screen readers.
Ensure both symbols and superscript can be enlarged without loss of content or
functionality. Don't use images of symbols or superscript.

Write numerals with units of
measurement
Use numerals, not words, for numbers when you are referring to a unit of measurement:
Always use numerals next to a unit of measurement.
Include a non-breaking space between the number and the unit.
Use symbols for common units of
measurement
You donʼt need to spell out units of measurement, even for the first use, if theyʼre well known
and users will know what they mean.Like this
5 t
5 tonnes
Not this

understand them. After that, use the symbols.
Donʼt combine symbols and words for units.
SI prefixes for large and small quantities
Internationally accepted prefixes and their symbols make it easier for users to read,
understand and compare numbers. Use them in government content.
Table 1 details common prefixes and their symbols.
A complete list of prefixes and symbols is available at The International Bureau of Weights
and Measures (BIPM) (https://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/).
Table 1: Commonly used prefixes for SI unitsExample
‘mmʼ for millimetres
‘cmʼ for centimetres
‘kmʼ for kilometres
‘km/hʼ for kilometres per hour
Example
The noise from the building site was 120 decibels (dB). Workers in the nearby office
preferred a limit of only 50 dB.
Like this

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/measurement-and-units 5/12Data storage and transfer
The prefixes for data storage and transfer work differently to those used for SI units.
‘Byteʼ (B) is the unit of storage and data transfer speed. For this purpose, use:
‘kilobyteʼ for 1,000 B
‘megabyteʼ for 1,024 kB
‘gigabyteʼ for 1,024 MB
‘terabyteʼ for 1,024 GB.
Units of time
Days, years, hours and minutes measure time. These are not SI units. Spell them out in full –
unless theyʼre in a table, list or chart and are easy to understand.
Use symbols for units that are derived from time measurements, such as speed.There was 5 µg of active ingredient in each capsule.
He measured 50 mL of water.
Not this
There was 5 mcg of active ingredient in each capsule.
He measured 5 dL of water.
Example
I have been working in the public service for 12 years.
He started in the new department 20 days ago.
They sent the report in the last 15 minutes.
Example
The speed limit for urban areas in NSW is 50 km/h.07/09/2024, 13:56 Measurement and units | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/measurement-and-units 6/12Put a non-breaking space
between numbers and units
People will read the number and its unit as a measurement only if the 2 components sit
together. To do this, use a non-breaking space between numbers and their units of
measurement.
Without a non-breaking space, a unit could reflow to the next line. This would separate it
from the quantity, making it difficult for users to understand the information being presented.
Although this is important for all content, itʼs more likely to happen on smaller screens, such
as those on mobile devices.
By convention, some industries donʼt have a space between the quantity and the unit. Many
750 mL bottles of wine, for example, have the volume 750mL printed on the label.
Check the preferred style if you are writing for a specialist application.
Donʼt add ‘sʼ for plural forms
Symbols for units of measurement represent both the singular and the plural forms. Donʼt
use an ‘sʼ to show plural with the symbols for units.Like this
The post should be at least 1.5 m tall.
[The sentence has a &nbsp; inserted between ‘1.5ʼ and ‘mʼ.]
Not this
The post should be at least 1.5
m tall.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/measurement-and-units 8/12Only use non-SI units if the user
understands them
There are other units that are also Australian legal units of measurement but are not SI units.
Theyʼre listed in Schedules 1 and 2 of the National Measurement Regulations
(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2019C00572).
These non-SI units are not all legally accepted in every country. Use them only if users will
understand them. Some units, such as the nautical mile, are for use only in Australia. Table 2
details common examples of other legal Australian units.

volume litre L or l
blood pressure millimetre of mercury mm Hg
work and energy kilocalorie kcal
Note: ‘litreʼ can be represented as ‘Lʼ or ‘lʼ, depending on the type of content and who will be
using it. Most government content should use ‘Lʼ as itʼs clearer to users (‘lʼ can be confused
with ‘Iʼ and ‘1ʼ).07/09/2024, 13:56 Measurement and units | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/measurement-and-units 9/12Avoid imperial units
Donʼt use imperial units of measurement in Australia unless you have a specific reason, such
as:
in quotations from historical documents
when writing for readers in countries (particularly the United States) where imperial
measures, or elements of them, still apply.
Itʼs good practice to also provide the equivalent quantity in SI units when that helps users.

Ordinal numbers
Ordinal numbers
Ordinal numbers, such as ‘firstʼ, ‘secondʼ and ‘thirdʼ, show the order, position or
importance of things in a list or sequence.
Use words for ordinals up to ‘ninthʼ and
numerals for ‘10thʼ and above
Spell out ordinal numbers from ‘firstʼ to ‘ninthʼ. Use numerals for ordinals from ‘10thʼ
onwards.
Ordinals written as numerals always have a suffix:
‘-stʼ (‘firstʼ, ‘21stʼ)
‘-ndʼ (‘secondʼ, ‘32ndʼ)
‘-rdʼ (‘thirdʼ, ‘103rdʼ)
‘-thʼ (‘fourthʼ, ‘15thʼ, ‘55thʼ and so on).
Donʼt write suffixes in superscript. Superscript may not be accessible to people who use
screen readers.
Example
The first item on the agenda was to confirm the agenda. The second item was to review
the minutes from the last meeting.07/09/2024, 13:56 Ordinal numbers | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/ordinal-numbers 1/8Exception to ordinals rule for centuries
Use numerals, not words, when writing ordinals with centuries
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-
measurements/dates-and-time#refer_to_specific_days_events_and_periods_with_capitals).
This is an exception to the general rule to spell out ‘firstʼ to ‘ninthʼ for ordinals.
Write ‘centuryʼ and ‘centuriesʼ in lower case.
Very large ordinals
People find very large rounded numbers easier to read in words rather than numerals
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-
measurements/choosing-numerals-or-
words#combine_numerals_and_words_for_large_rounded_numbers). This also applies to
ordinal numbers. Spell out the number and include the relevant suffix.In 2013, Canberra celebrated its 100th anniversary.

In reference lists, use numerals with a suffix for editions of a publication. This is an exception
to the rule to use words for ordinal numbers up to ninth.
Ordinals in organisation names
If an organisationʼs name includes a numeral, write the name as the organisation does. This
is an exception to the rule to use words for ordinal numbers up to ninth.
Create a list rather than use ordinals
Donʼt use ordinals to order points in general content. Reword the content so it doesnʼt need
ordinals or use a numbered list instead. A list can make it easier for people to follow the
sequence.
Always use numbered lists rather than ordinals when youʼre expressing a series of items or
steps – for example, in recommendations or instructions.the 1,000,000th visitor

Ordinals, such as ‘firstlyʼ and ‘secondlyʼ, are sometimes used in content written for
government publications such as journals and reports. In this type of content, they order
thoughts without interrupting the flow of the text.
‘Firstlyʼ and ‘secondlyʼ work as a pair. Donʼt use one without the other.
Donʼt use ‘thirdlyʼ. Instead, omit ordinals and write the points as a run-on list in a sentence. . submit a business case

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/ordinal-numbers 5/8Use a non-breaking space for names with regnal numbers
Put a non-breaking space between the name and the regnal number. A non-breaking space
means that line breaks wonʼt split up both elements of the name. The name and number will
stay together on one line.
You can insert a non-breaking space using the Unicode character U+00A0.
In HTML, use the entity &nbsp; to insert a non-breaking space. You can also use the
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar in Word.
Print considerations
Use a narrow no-break space between the name and the regnal number.
The narrow no-break space ensures that the:
name and number stay together on one line
spacing between name and number doesnʼt change when text is justified.
You can insert a narrow no-break space using the Unicode character U+202F.

Telephone numbers
Telephone numbers
Write telephone numbers so people can read and use them easily. There are
rules for grouping the numbers, using spacing and creating links.
Use ‘chunksʼ of digits to help people
read telephone numbers
Break telephone numbers into shorter blocks of digits or ‘chunksʼ.
Telephone numbers are easier to read when their digits are chunked, rather than written in
one large group.
Australian telephone numbers in general use have no more than 10 digits:
Landlines – 2 digits for the area code followed by 8 digits for the rest of the telephone
number.
Mobiles – 10 digits (there is no area code).
There are also categories of telephone numbers that donʼt have 10 digits – for example, ‘13ʼ
numbers have 6 digits.
Example
02 5550 4321 [A landline number in NSW or the ACT]07/09/2024, 13:56 Telephone numbers | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/telephone-numbers 1/7Put a non-breaking space between the
chunks of digits
Use a non-breaking space between chunks of digits in a telephone number. A non-breaking
space means that line breaks wonʼt split up the number. The telephone number will stay
together on one line.
You can insert a non-breaking space using the Unicode character U+00A0.
In HTML, use the entity &nbsp; to insert a non-breaking space. You can also use the
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar in Word.
Print considerations
Use a narrow no-break space between chunks of digits in a telephone number.
The narrow no-break space ensures that the:
telephone number stays together on one line
spacing between digits doesnʼt change when text is justified.
You can insert a narrow no-break space using the Unicode character U+202F.0491 570 159 [An Australian mobile number]

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/telephone-numbers 2/7Write telephone numbers in the national
or international format
Write telephone numbers in a format appropriate for the location of the users.
National format for telephone numbers
Use Australiaʼs national format when writing Australian telephone numbers for content that
will be used within Australia.
For landline telephone numbers, write the 2-digit area code followed by a non-breaking
space. Then write the rest of the number in 2 chunks of 4 digits.
Write mobile telephone numbers in 1 chunk of 4 digits and then 2 chunks of 3 digits.
International format for telephone numbers
Use international format for content that will be used outside Australia.
The international format uses a plus sign ʼ+ʼ to represent the international prefix, followed by
a country code (‘61ʼ for Australia).
For landline numbers:
start with a plus sign ‘+ʼ and add the country code (‘61ʼ for Australia)
add the area code without the ‘0ʼ
write the telephone number in 2 chunks of 4 digits.
For mobile numbers:Example
02 5550 4321 [Telephone]
0491 570 159 [Mobile]
Example
+61 3 7010 4321 [Landline]07/09/2024, 13:56 Telephone numbers | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/telephone-numbers 3/7start with a plus sign ‘+ʼ and add the country code (‘61ʼ for Australia)
omit the first ‘0ʼ
write the telephone number in 3 chunks of 3 digits.
Always write foreign telephone numbers in the international format.
Make telephone numbers accessible
through ‘click-to-callʼ functionality
‘Click-to-callʼ allows users to call a telephone number by selecting (clicking) the number
shown in content. When the user selects the number, the userʼs mobile phone, other mobile
device or personal computer (if it has a supporting application) calls the number.
Click-to-call makes telephone numbers more accessible because users donʼt need to copy
the number manually. Click-to-call also works with screen readers.
Devices sometimes recognise when a number in content is a telephone number and
automatically treat the number as a click-to-call link. This is not always the case, so use
HTML code to support this functionality. Seek specialist advice if youʼre unsure of how to do
this.
Using HTML for click-to-call
Use ‘tel:[telephone number]ʼ as the URL. Remove spaces between the numbers.
Remember that all webpages can be accessed internationally. Include the international
dialling prefix if appropriate.Example
+61 491 578 888 [Mobile]
Example
+1 212 555 0188 [US landline]
+44 20 7946 0990 [UK landline]

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/numbers-and-measurements/telephone-numbers 4/7Don't use ‘phone wordsʼ
Always display the telephone number as digits. Donʼt use ‘phone wordsʼ. Use the relevant 13
or 1300 number instead.
Some organisations use phone words to advertise their telephone number as a digit-word
combination. Donʼt do this, because some people find it hard to convert letters to numbers.02 5550 5722 (tel:0255500000) [HTML: <a

Australian place names
Australian place names
Spell official place names correctly. Follow style rules so people recognise
names for other public places. Use standard shortened forms in addresses.
Check official place names and style
them correctly
Using official Australian place names helps us all communicate more clearly. You can check
the spelling of a place name using the Australian Place Names dataset
(https://placenames.fsdf.org.au/).
If still unsure, contact the relevant state or territory naming authority. You can click on the
government logos in the search results from the dataset. They will take you to the
jurisdictional webpage.
Official place names are generally given under Acts of parliament and associated rules. Each
state and territory has its own legal and administrative processes.
National principles for naming are intended to provide consistency across the country. This
helps ensure that wherever we go in Australia, we find names are chosen and spelt in a
common way.
Place names reflect culture at various points throughout history. Because of this reality, there
may appear to be exceptions to the general rules given in this guide.07/09/2024, 13:56 Australian place names | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/australian-place-names 1/9There are many First Nations naming systems across Australia. These were in place before
the official national system and continue today.
Many names from First Nations languages have become official names, used by all
Australians. There are also many that have not. Consult directly with relevant communities
about conventions for naming and spelling in specific First Nations languages (/node/179).
Spelling and capitalisation
Australian place names are proper nouns, written using standard Australian English. Place
names:
use a standard 26 character alphabet
donʼt use diacritical marks
are not possessive
donʼt generally have punctuation.
Some Australian place names stem from other languages. Spelling and capitalisation can
change when theyʼre adopted as an official Australian place name. For example, the official
spelling:
loses any accent marks or diacritics
adds capitalisation.
Punctuation
Hyphens and apostrophes can be part of an official name. They appear if they were part of
the name of the person commemorated by the place name.Correct

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/australian-place-names 2/9Australian places have official names derived from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
languages. Some places have official dual names from those languages and English.
When writing official dual names, use a spaced forward slash to separate the 2 parts of the
name. The order should be as written in the official name, which you can check in
the Australian Place Names dataset (https://placenames.fsdf.org.au/).
Some official Tasmanian place names do not follow the convention of using initial capitals for
proper nouns.
Use capitals for names of places, roads
and streets
Words that donʼt usually need an initial capital have one when they are part of a place name.
The names of roads, streets and other thoroughfares also take an initial capital.Incorrect

topographic features (/node/135).
Use shortened forms for addresses
Addresses usually have abbreviations and contractions. Do not add punctuation marks to
these.
Common abbreviations include:

Tce (Terrace).
Shortened state and territory names for addresses
When addressing a letter, write the last line in capitals without punctuation or underlining,
with the postcode last. The last line should contain the place name or post office of delivery,
state or territory abbreviation and postcode. 
If you are sending mail overseas, spell out all names in the address in full to avoid confusion.
Write the names of buildings, structures
and public places with an initial capital
Names of buildings, structures and public places have initial capitals. Write generic and
plural terms in lower case.
Use initial capitals for the names of private properties. Example

in 4 situations
Spell out the names of Australian states and territories in formal content.
You can use shortened forms when:
the name is used as an adjective
space is limited
the full name would result in repetition
you are writing an address.
Donʼt use a full stop after the shortened forms. This rule applies to the initialisms (NSW, WA,
ACT and NT), abbreviations (Vic and Tas) and the contraction (Qld).
States and territories are generally listed in an order when more than one is mentioned. For
example:
in alphabetical order (ACT to WA)
by population size (NSW to NT).Tocal Homestead

Commercial terms
Brands and model names are protected by law. Unless using common names,
write trade mark names and use symbols so people can understand legal
status.
Use initial capitals for commercial terms
Use initial capitals for trade marks, brands and business names.
An exception to using initial capitals is where the business itself uses an unusual mix of
spacing, capitals and lower case letters. In this case, write it the way the business writes it.Example

nbn07/09/2024, 13:56 Commercial terms | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/commercial-terms 1/6Donʼt use an initial capital at the start of sentences when the trade mark or brand starts with
a lower case letter.
Use initial capitals for the proprietary names of drugs and other chemicals, but lower case
for generic names.
Spelling of ‘trade markʼ
‘Trade markʼ is spelled as 2 words in the Trade Marks Act 1995
(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A04969). Use this spelling when writing for
government, even though most dictionaries prefer ‘trademarkʼ.
You should also spell ‘trade markʼ as 2 words when you use it as a verb, although itʼs better
to say ‘register a trade markʼ.UNIX

Example
eBay is a popular online auction site.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/commercial-terms 2/6Use a common word for a product if you
can
Avoid using trade marks and brand names if possible. Instead use a generic word.
The ® and ™ symbols
Avoid using the registered (®) symbol or the trade mark (™) symbol for trade marks if
possible.
The registered symbol shows a trade mark is registered. A business doesnʼt have to use the
symbol for protecting its intellectual property. Itʼs illegal to use it if the trade mark is not
registered.
The trade mark symbol can be used with registered and unregistered trade marks.
Businesses can use it when they intend to register the term or when registration is pending.
The symbol doesnʼt protect the intellectual property of the trade mark.
Find more guidance in the Australian Government intellectual property manual
(https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/media-centre/publications/australian-government-
intellectual-property-manual ).
Take care using product names
The way a trade mark or brand is written is part of the intellectual property of its owner.
Trade mark owners sometimes take legal action to prevent names being used in a generic
sense.Write this

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/commercial-terms 3/6If a term is still registered as a trade mark, you should use it only for that brand and use a
capital letter. This may vary between different countries.
Itʼs more difficult when brands are becoming generic terms but are also still used as trade
marks. ‘Thermosʼ and ‘Hooverʼ are examples.
Dictionaries show the way such words are used. Donʼt rely on dictionaries to work out if such
words have legal status as trade marks.
Find out if a trade mark has been registered in Australia by using Australian trade mark
search (https://search.ipaustralia.gov.au/trademarks/search/quick). If youʼre not sure, seek
legal advice.
A product name can change meaning when used in the
generic sense
A few words have different meanings when used as a trade mark or used generically.
Other brand names have become so widely used that they are no longer associated with a
specific product. They have become common household names used in a generic sense.
They start with lower case except at the start of a sentence.Example
Band-Aid [A sticking plaster; initial capitals only for that brand]
bandaid [A word meaning a temporary or makeshift solution to a problem]

Medical terms
Medical terms have specific meanings. Introduce scientific terms and common
names if that helps users, but always use the correct spelling and style.
Use capitals for proper nouns and genus
names
Use an initial capital letter for medical terms only if the term is a proper noun or adjective, or
if it is the name of a genus. Otherwise donʼt use initial capitals for the names of:
diseases and viruses
diagnostic procedures
syndromes
anatomical parts.
Example
hepatitis B
Hendra virus
foot-and-mouth disease
Golgi apparatus
Tourette syndrome07/09/2024, 13:57 Medical terms | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/medical-terms 1/7Shortened forms
Use capital letters for acronyms and initialisms of medical terms. Spell out the full term in
lower case, unless the word or term youʼre shortening includes a proper name or a genus
name.
Spelling for eponyms
Some terms are named after the people who discovered, studied or described the specific
anatomical part or disease. Other terms are named after people who had a particular
disease.
All of these terms are called ‘eponymsʼ. Eponyms appear as different types of adjectives in
medical terms. They are usually possessive adjectives.
When referring to an eponym in writing, use the following rules:
If it is a disease named after people who had the disease, use the possessive case.
If it is a disease or anatomical part named after the person who discovered, studied or
described it, donʼt use the possessive case.computed tomography

Example
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP) disease
sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/medical-terms 2/7This rule doesnʼt apply to names of organisations dedicated to studying certain diseases or
supporting people who are affected by them. Always refer to organisations in the same way
as they refer to themselves.
Italicise organism names
Write scientific names of infectious organisms – such as viruses, bacteria and parasites – in
italics. Use an initial capital for the name of the genus only.
Cite common names for pharmaceutical
drugs, not brand names
Use the generic names of drugs where possible. Write them in lower case.
You can include the brand name in parentheses after the common name. Use initial capitals
for brand names. Commercial terms might be trade marked: take care using product names
(/node/89#take_care_using_product_names).Legionnairesʼ disease [Named after members of the American Legion – known as
Legionnaires – who were the first documented people to have the disease]

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/medical-terms 3/7Refer to medical conditions using clear
and inclusive language
The language you use for some medical conditions can change as research and social
understanding of the conditions evolve. Be mindful of outdated language that can
perpetuate stigma or misunderstandings about the condition.
Refer to peak bodies that study the condition or that provide support and information to
people affected by it.
When you are writing about people with a medical condition, focus on the person. Use
neutral language to describe the condition. Donʼt label the person.Example
benzoyl peroxide (Benzac)
paracetamol (Panadol)
Example
The term ‘bipolar disorderʼ replaces ‘manic depressionʼ, a term that is no longer in use.
Write this

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/medical-terms 4/7If youʼre writing both the scientific and common names for a medical condition, place the
scientific name in parentheses. Donʼt use ‘orʼ. This could confuse readers into thinking they
are 2 separate medical conditions.

Nationalities, peoples and places
outside Australia
Refer to peoples and places outside Australia based on current information.
Correct spelling and style avoids causing confusion or offence among users.
Check official sources for country and
place names
Some countries have several official names. Consult trusted references to decide which
name to use, then use it consistently. Helpful references include:
the countries, economies and regions (https://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/pages/countries-
and-regions) webpages, on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website
the United Nations geographical names database
(https://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/geonames/)
the Australian Bureau of Statistics Standard Australian classification of countries
(https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1269.0Main+Features102016?

Example
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is often called the ‘United
Kingdomʼ.07/09/2024, 13:57 Nationalities, peoples and places outside Australia | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/nationalities-peoples-and-places-outside-australia 1/8The names of countries can change for political reasons. For example, a country might
change its name to show independence from a former occupying country.
Country boundaries can also change.
Spell country names with a capital letter
Use initial capitals for:
the official name of a country
any commonly used short forms of the countryʼs name
the names of states, territories and provinces.
The definite article ‘theʼ isnʼt capitalised unless it begins a sentence.
Shorten a country name only if it is clear
to the user
Use a short form of a countryʼs name only if itʼs clear and accurate. Shortened forms can
make it easier to read text or tables, illustrations, notes, lists and bibliographies.Example
The Democratic Republic of the Congo used to be called ‘Zaireʼ. The former name came
from the Portuguese colonial name for the Congo River.
Example
the Cayman Islands – the Caymans
the Falkland Islands – the Falklands
Example
‘North Koreaʼ is the shortened form of the Democratic Peopleʼs Republic of Korea.07/09/2024, 13:57 Nationalities, peoples and places outside Australia | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/nationalities-peoples-and-places-outside-australia 2/8Use English versions of countries and
places in most content
English-language content usually uses the English version of a countryʼs name.
There are some cases where the preferred official name isnʼt in English.
In English-speaking countries, the convention is to use the established English forms for
well-known place names.Example
‘Socialist Republic of Vietnamʼ is the English version of Cộng hòa xã hội chủ nghĩa Việt
Nam.
‘Germanyʼ is the English version of Deutschland.
‘New Zealandʼ is the English version of Aotearoa.
‘The Czech Republicʼ or ‘Czechiaʼ are the English versions of Česká republika.
Example
‘Côte dʼIvoireʼ is the preferred official name for the Ivory Coast.
‘Eswatiniʼ is the preferred name for Swaziland.
Example

Krakow
Rome
Brussels

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/nationalities-peoples-and-places-outside-australia 3/8When the name is used generically, you donʼt need an initial capital.
Check the official status for area and
region names
Groups of nations or areas that are recognised as political or geographic regions take initial
capitals.
Use lower case if the names of compass points (such as north and south-east) are not part
of the name but are used to refer to the geographic area.
Some names that arenʼt officially recognised become well known and gain a semi-official
status. Use a dictionary to help you decide when this is appropriate.Example
brussels sprout [A type of sprout, not a sprout from Brussels]
venetian blind [A type of screen for a window, not a blind from Venice]
french door [A type of door, not a door from France]
Example
South-East Asia
Central America
the Balkans
Example
southern Germany
northern Iraq
Example

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/nationalities-peoples-and-places-outside-australia 4/8Write nationalities, peoples and places
with initial capitals
Thereʼs usually a clear relationship between the name of the country or region and the word
used for the nationality. Itʼs not always obvious though, so check a dictionary to ensure
youʼre using the correct term.
Follow guidance for writing non-English personal names (/node/90).
Capitalise the names of certain groups.Example
Türkiye – Turkish
Melanesia – Melanesian
the Philippines – Filipino
Congo – Congolese
United Arab Emirates – Emirati
New Zealand – New Zealander
Example
People groups – Hispanic, Sentinelese, Vietnamese Rục, Sámi
Clans – Clan Campbell (Scottish)
People from particular regions – Asian, European, Sumatran, Basque
People who follow particular religions – Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu,
Greek Orthodox
People who speak particular languages – Hokkien-speaking07/09/2024, 13:57 Nationalities, peoples and places outside Australia | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/nationalities-peoples-and-places-outside-australia 5/8Check if an official language differs from
the country name
The name of a countryʼs language isnʼt always derived from the name of the country.

Natural phenomena
Natural phenomena
Treat terms for climate and weather events with consistent style. It helps users
scan content for keywords and supports readability.
Standard rules of capitalisation apply
for most natural phenomena
Follow the rules of capitalisation for most natural phenomena:
Proper nouns start with a capital letter.
Adjectives and common nouns are in lower case.
Do not use italics.
Most terms are usually in lower case
Write generic terms for climate and weather in lower case. This rule applies to many
compound nouns.
Example
climate change, global warming, greenhouse gases07/09/2024, 13:57 Natural phenomena | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/natural-phenomena 1/6Specific terms usually take lower case. For example, this rule applies to scientific names for
types of clouds.
Terms for specific phenomena can
take initial capitals
Scientific terms for natural phenomena can include common nouns that combine to form a
proper noun.
Use initial capitals when spelling out this kind of scientific term. Common shortened forms
are in full capitals. Any non-English names retain the spelling of the original.
Climate and weather events take on
proper names
Individual climate and weather events have names to help communicate the event to the
public.
There are specific capitalisation rules for climate and weather events. We follow the style
recommended by Australiaʼs Bureau of Meteorology.
For events not listed here, follow the standard rules for capitalisation.
Cyclones are usually given peopleʼs names
Use initial capitals for the names of cyclones.Example
cumulonimbus, cirrus and stratus
Example
Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)
Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)07/09/2024, 13:57 Natural phenomena | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/natural-phenomena 2/6Do this for the given name and for the adjectives and common nouns that appear
immediately before the given name. The bureau uses ‘Cycloneʼ, ‘Tropical Cycloneʼ and
‘Severe Tropical Cycloneʼ as part of the cycloneʼs name.
Check the name is accurate on the bureauʼs website (http://www.bom.gov.au/).
Use the same rule for hurricanes and typhoons. These are different terms for the same
natural phenomenon.
Always write ‘Cycloneʼ as part of the name unless it is clear from the surrounding text that
you are referring to a cyclone.
Droughts are usually named after a period in time
If the time is a formal period, the name has an initial capital.Example
Cyclone Yasi
Tropical Cyclone Winifred
Severe Tropical Cyclone Damien
Hurricane Wilma
Typhoon Fengshen
Example
Hilda was the first cyclone in the Australian region to make landfall in the 2017–18
season.
Cyclone Hilda made landfall in the 2017–18 season.
Example
Millennium drought
Federation drought

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/natural-phenomena 3/6Fires are usually named for a time or location
Bushfires take initial capitals for the adjectival part of their name as well as any proper noun.
Fires leading to substantial loss of life and property are usually named after the worst day or
where they started.
During a fire, authorities usually name a fire based on where it started.
Floods, earthquakes and tsunamis are named by year,
location and event
Use ‘year Location eventʼ as the naming convention for floods, earthquakes and
tsunamis. Only the location (the proper noun) has an initial capital.Example
State Mine fire (New South Wales, 2013)
Black Saturday bushfires (Victoria, 2009)
Ash Wednesday bushfires (Victoria and South Australia, 1983)
Black Tuesday bushfires (Tasmania, 1967)
Black Friday bushfires (Victoria and New South Wales, 1939)
Black Thursday bushfires (Victoria, 1851)

Organisation names
Organisation names
Spell and punctuate organisation names correctly. This helps people to
understand your content.
Write the name as the organisation
writes it
Organisations determine how their names should be spelt and punctuated. This does not
always follow the usual rules.
Write the name of the organisation the same way the organisation writes it. This rule applies
except in rare cases when the organisation name is in all lower case. Use an initial capital for
these names in body text. This helps people identify the name as a proper noun.
Some names start with a lower case letter but have a medial capital (for example, ‘eBayʼ).
Write the name the same way, including to begin a sentence. A medial capital is enough to
identify the name as a proper noun.
Pay attention to the use of capital letters, punctuation (such as apostrophes) and logograms
(such as ‘&ʼ). Make sure to include all words in the name. Donʼt add additional words.Example
eSafety keeps tips on its website topical and up to date.07/09/2024, 13:57 Organisation names | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/organisation-names 1/9Check the correct name of an
organisation
The names of organisations can change. The most efficient way to confirm an organisationʼs
name is to check its website, annual report or letterhead. If this is unsuccessful, there are
other reliable services.
For Australian Government entities, use the government online directory
(https://www.directory.gov.au/). Directory entries contain links to departmental pages listing
annual reports. Annual reports are a good way to find the former names of departments.
The government online directory includes the Australian Government Organisations Register
and the directories of state and territory governments. There are also website directories for
some local governments.
For non-government entities, use:
the Australian Securities Exchange's listed companies
(https://www.asx.com.au/asx/research/listedCompanies.do)
the Australian Securities and Investments Commission registers
(https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/RegistrySearch/faces/landing/SearchRegisters.jspx?
_adf.ctrl-state=p64f240em_12)
For all entities, use:Example
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ['United Nationsʼ
doesn't have an apostrophe because it is descriptive
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/style-rules-and-conventions/punctuation-
marks/apostrophes#descriptive_phrases_dont_need_apostrophes). Note the variant
spelling of ‘Organizationʼ.]
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) [The ampersand is part of the
initialism but not the spelt-out form.]
State Library Victoria [The name is not the ‘State Library of Victoriaʼ. It does not include
a preposition.]
Meat & Livestock Australia [The ampersand is part of the name.]07/09/2024, 13:57 Organisation names | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/organisation-names 2/9the Australian Business Register's ABN lookup (https://abr.business.gov.au/)
a publication that lists organisations such as the Directory of Australian associations
or Margaret Geeʼs media guide, if your organisation has access.
If you cite a source written by an organisation that has since changed its name, use the name
that was published in the source. This may be the organisationʼs or government
department's past name (https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/style-rules-and-
conventions/referencing-and-attribution/author-
date#order_the_elements_of_each_item_in_a_reference_list).
Capital letters in registered business names
Some organisation names appearing on the Australian Business Register have all capitals.
Our first rule applies:write the name as the organisation does.
Check the organisation's website and publications to find how it capitalises its name and
follow the organisation's preferred style.
Shortened forms of the name
Use the organisationʼs shortened form only if the organisation regularly uses it in its own
content.
For example, the Department of Home Affairs uses ‘Home Affairsʼ as the shortened form. It
would be inappropriate to use ‘DHAʼ to refer to Home Affairs. However, Defence Housing
Australia does use the initialism ‘DHAʼ, so using it to refer to that organisation would be
appropriate.Example
Before September 2013, the Department of Social Services was called the ‘Department
of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairsʼ.
Example
MySA GOV [All capitals for 'GOV' is the preferred style. The registered business name
has the same capitalisation.]
The Smith Family [Initial capitals is the preferred style. The registered business name is
'THE SMITH FAMILY' in all capitals.]07/09/2024, 13:57 Organisation names | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/organisation-names 3/9Spell out the shortened form the first time, unless the organisationʼs name is known only by
the shortened form.
Shortened forms as part of the name
Some organisations use shortened forms such as ‘Ltdʼ, ‘Pty Ltdʼ, ‘Coʼ and ‘Incʼ as part of their
legal name. Others use the spelt-out forms.
Don't add a full stop at the end of ‘Coʼ and ‘Incʼ unless they finish a sentence. No full stop is
the correct Australian Government style for abbreviations
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/format-writing-and-structure/clear-language-and-writing-
style/plain-language-and-word-
choice/abbreviations#dont_put_a_full_stop_after_most_abbreviations).
Use the organisationʼs full title on first mention in a publication. On subsequent mentions in
print documents, you can omit words like ‘proprietaryʼ and ‘limitedʼ and the
corresponding shortened forms.Write this
Zoning laws allowed IKEA to lease the land.
Defence Housing Australia (DHA) provides housing for Defence members and their
families. DHA also provides other related services.
Not this
Zoning laws allowed Ingvar Kamprad Elmtaryd Agunnaryd (IKEA) to lease the land.
DHA provides housing for Defence members and their families.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/organisation-names 4/9Capitalise organisationsʼ names in 2
situations
Use initial capitals for:
all words capitalised in the full, official names of organisations
the first mention of an organisation.
Donʼt use an initial capital for:
generic terms – such as ‘the departmentʼor ‘the agencyʼ – even if the organisation
being referenced capitalises the generic term in its content
mentions of several organisations with the same generic name.
In body text, use lower case for the definite article in the
names of organisations
Some organisations use the definite article ‘Theʼ in their name with an initial capital. Use the
full name, including ‘Theʼ, in 2 situations:
in emails and letters (/node/50)Example
Australian Academy of the Humanities – the academy
Department of Finance – the department
The departments of Health and Finance – the departments
Western Sydney University – the university
Australian Ballet Company – the company
Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial
Services Industry – the royal commission
Gundagai Shire Council – the shire council/the council
Regional Australia Summit – the summit07/09/2024, 13:57 Organisation names | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/organisation-names 5/9if the name appears in an alphabetical list (arrange by ‘Theʼ as the first word in the
name).
Always use lower case ‘theʼ in body text. This follows the practice of most organisations.
If organisations omit the definite article from their name, donʼt use it in emails and letters. In
body text, ‘theʼ appears before the correct name or isnʼt needed at all.
Put a possessive apostrophe in a name if
the organisation does
Use an apostrophe only when it forms part of the official name of an organisation.
In all other cases for organisation names, donʼt use possessive apostrophes (/node/106).
The apostrophe is disappearing from many organisational names, particularly from those
that contain plural nouns ending in ‘sʼ. In these cases, the plural noun is descriptive rather
than possessive.Example
The University of Sydney [Correct name, not ‘University of Sydneyʼ]
Next year the University of Sydney will renovate its science buildings. [Body text uses
lower case for ‘theʼ]
Example
Charles Sturt University [Correct name, not ‘The Charles Sturt Universityʼ]
Research at Charles Sturt University examined whether early Australian wheat varieties
caused allergic reactions. [Body text does not use ‘theʼ]
Example

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/organisation-names 6/9Use the singular verb with organisation
names
The rules of grammar allow the use of a plural or singular verb with the names of
organisations. This is not Australian Government style.
Always use a singular verb. This applies even if organisation names end in an ‘sʼand look
plural.Example

Personal names
Getting personal names right is respectful. It also helps users avoid any
confusion. Check that youʼve used the correct spelling, punctuation and
capitalisation.
Use the right name
When you write to or about people, always use the form of personal name that the person
uses. If you can, ask the person which name they prefer. Otherwise, consult reputable
sources for:
Names of people who work within government or in roles related to government,
including state and territory governments: Directory.gov.au
(https://www.directory.gov.au/).
Records of names of people closely associated with Australia: The National Archives of
Australia (https://www.naa.gov.au/help-your-research/getting-started/commonwealth-

Historical and biographical information: The Australian dictionary of biography
(http://adb.anu.edu.au/) and Trove (https://trove.nla.gov.au/).
Information on prominent Australians, search ‘eResourcesʼ such as Whoʼs who in

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/personal-names 1/10Names are important to a personʼs sense of self. To avoid cultural or gender bias when
referring to parts of names, use:
‘given nameʼ instead of ‘Christian nameʼ
‘family nameʼ instead of ‘surnameʼ
‘previous namesʼ instead of ‘maiden nameʼ.
Use initial capitals for personal names,
initials and nicknames
Use initial capitals for the names of real and fictitious people.
Capitalise the initials of peopleʼs given names. Write them unspaced and without full stops.
Use non-breaking spaces to ensure that initials are not separated from family names.Example

quotation marks.
Be aware that a few people donʼt use capitals for their names. This is a deliberate style
decision that is part of their personal identity. Examples include bell hooks and kd lang. Use
the form the person uses.
Spell plural forms correctly
The plural of any personal name is formed by adding ‘sʼ or ‘esʼ. It depends on the spelling of
the personal name (Table 1).

Keep hyphens and all parts of compound
family names
Always retain hyphens when you write given and family names that are hyphenated.
Write all parts of compound family names. Keep the compound when writing a personʼs
family name.
Sometimes someone has more than one family name but is only known by one. Write all the
names the first time and use the well-known family name after.
To decide which name to use, ask the person if you can. Otherwise, check works they have
written, personal correspondence from them or reliable sources about them.Example
Kath Day-Knight
Alen-Igor OʼHran
Example
William Delafield Cook [‘Delafield Cookʼ is a compound name.]

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/personal-names 5/10Follow reliable sources for non-English
names
As far as possible, if you need to write a non-English name, use the same form and spelling
as the person uses. Check their personal correspondence or works they have written. If you
can, ask them how you should address them. As a last resort, use the name that is most
commonly used in writing about the person.
Pay attention to the order of names
The order of names is culturally based. In many English-speaking countries, the order of a
name is given name then family name. However, other cultures use family names first.
Some people change the order of their name when they move countries.
If you can, ask the person which name is their family name and how they would prefer to be
addressed. Follow guidance for how to write about nationalities, peoples and places outside
Australia (/node/133).
Keep accents and diacritic marks in names
Given and family names sometimes have diacritic marks or symbols, including accents, such
as à, á, â, ã, ä, ė, ē, ĕ, ę.
When you write names, retain diacritic marks unless the person commonly uses a simplified
form of their name.
Insert diacritic marks into your document with the Unicode Standard
(https://www.unicode.org/charts/) – for example, U+00E8 is è. In word processing
applications, you can also use the ASCII extended character set (https://www.ascii-
code.com).Example
Chinese–Australian economist Professor Xiaokai Yang was born Yang Xiguang. Yang is
his family name. He changed his given name to Xiaokai after being released from prison
in China. He is known by Xiaokai Yang in the US and Australia, but as Yang Xiaokai in
China.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/personal-names 6/10Treat names with particles case by case
Some family names contain a particle, such as ‘dellaʼ, ‘Alʼ or ‘vonʼ.
It is sometimes difficult to decide how to capitalise these personal names in English.
Use the same capitalisation as the person uses. It is largely a matter of individual preference
and family custom. If you canʼt ask them, use reliable resources to decide on a case-by-case
basis, then use the same form throughout the content.
Most, but not all, particles are written in lower case.
The particle is sometimes omitted when the given name is omitted.Renée Geyer

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/personal-names 7/10Always use an initial capital for the particle when a name starts a sentence. You can also
rephrase the sentence to retain the original form.
List family name first in reference lists
In a reference list, put the family name first and then the initial for the given name of the lead
author.
Follow the rules for the author–date system to create an alphabetically ordered list
(/node/165#alphabetise_the_reference_items_in_the_list).
Names you pronounce the same way but spell differently go together in an alphabetical list.Richard Di Natale – Di Natale [The particle is included.]

Plants and animals
Plants and animals
Names for plants and animals come from classification systems. The right style
for the classification conveys meaning to people reading the content.
Italicise genus and species names
The genus and species form the definitive name of a plant or animal. By convention:
the genus is in italics and takes an initial capital
the species is in italics and is lower case.
Subspecies and the names of varieties are also italicised. In these names, abbreviations for
the words ‘subspeciesʼ and ‘varietyʼ take a full stop. This is an exception to the general rule
for abbreviations (/node/184#dont_put_a_full_stop_after_most_abbreviations).Example
Backhousia citriodora is the scientific name of the lemon myrtle.
Ornithorhynchus anatinus is the scientific name of the platypus.
Example
Eucalyptus pauciflorasubsp. hedraia is a subspecies of snow gum found only in the
Mount Bogong and Falls Creek areas of Victoria.07/09/2024, 13:57 Plants and animals | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/plants-and-animals 1/12Accessibility requirements
Screen readers donʼt pronounce italics. Use the semantic tag <em> to provide
emphasis for italicised names in HTML.
Write common names in lower case and
roman type
Most plants and animals have a common name as well as their genus and species name.
For common names:
Use lower case unless they are also a proper noun, a registered trade mark or in some
specialised content such as genetics.
Do not use italics.
Use initial capitals when the name includes a proper noun.Acacia alatavar. platyptera is a variety of winged wattle that is found only in Western
Australia.
Example
The Tasmanian devil is named after its home range of Tasmania.
The grasslands were home to more than a million red kangaroos.
Tuross River was home to a family of platypus.
Example
Norfolk Island pine

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/plants-and-animals 2/12Plant and animal names that are also common English words
Names that have become everyday words are shown in roman type and donʼt need a capital
letter.
This includes English derivatives. These are plant and animal names that came from the
scientific classification system and are now in everyday use.
You usually donʼt need to use an initial capital for breeds, even if they are derived from a
regional name.
Registered trade marks
Use an initial capital for names of registered cultivars or breeds. In a sentence, the registered
name is sometimes in quotation marks.Example
acacia
eucalypt
Example
feline [From the subfamily Felinae]
carnivore [From the order Carnivora]
Example
labrador
siamese cat
friesian cattle
Example
Acacia‘Cascadeʼ is a registered cultivar derived from Australian native flora.07/09/2024, 13:57 Plants and animals | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/plants-and-animals 3/12Itʼs best to check a dictionary or another reputable source to confirm whether the name has
an initial capital. Refer to related guidance on commercial terms
(/node/89#take_care_using_product_names).
Birds (ornithology)
In generalist Australian Government content, use lower case for the names of birds unless
the name contains a proper noun.
This style may vary in some specialist content and content following international
conventions. If writing for these, check and use the style that readers will understand. For
example, in some contexts the common names of bird species start with a capital letter but
are lower case when used as a generic term.
In both generalist and specialist content, use lower case for bird names in a list of common
names of plants and animals.
Genetics
When using genetic terms for plants and animals:
Use italics for the names of genes.Example
The silver gull (Larus novaehollandiae) is a common gull of the Australian coast.
South-west Western Australia is the only place where Carnabyʼs black cockatoo is
found.
Example
The Silver Gull (Larus novaehollandiae) is frequently observed in Australian coastal
regions.
A species of cockatoo, Carnabyʼs Black Cockatoo, is native to south-west Western
Australia.
Example
The area was inhabited by green tree frogs, carpet pythons, bush rats and silver gulls.07/09/2024, 13:57 Plants and animals | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/plants-and-animals 4/12Use roman type for the names of proteins (enzymes).
Capitalisation varies for the names of genes, but proteins usually take an initial capital only.
Include the genus and species at first
mention of the common name
The common name of a plant or animal can be a local name for more than one species in
different places. Only the scientific name is the definitive name.
For this reason, include the species name in parentheses when you first mention the
common name so it is clear which plant or animal you are writing about.
A common name is often a local name for a species:
A common name can be used for several species.
A species can have different common names in different places.Example
In plants, the gene Sbe1 encodes starch-branching enzyme one, Sbe1.
Example
Royal grevillea (Grevillea victoriae) is one of more than 350 species in the genus
Grevillea.
Example
Black wattle is used as a common name for several Acacia species, such as Acacia
mearnsii, A. aulacocarpa, A. auriculiformis, A. concurrens and A. crassicarpa.
Acacia dealbata is known by several common names, such as ‘silver wattleʼ, ‘blue wattleʼ
and ‘mimosaʼ.07/09/2024, 13:57 Plants and animals | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/plants-and-animals 5/12When the genus is repeated, it can be abbreviated
If you have already written the full name of the genus, use a shortened form for later
mentions. This is often just the first letter of the genus name, followed by a full stop. This is
an exception to the general rule for abbreviations
(/node/184#dont_put_a_full_stop_after_most_abbreviations).
When there are several genera that start with the same letter, include the second letter in the
abbreviation.
Refer to classification systems to help
you name plants and animals
Plants and animals are classified in a hierarchy from general to specific. The style you use is
set by where the name is in the hierarchy:
Names down to genus level start with capital letters.
Species names are in lower case.
Genus and species names are in italics.
The examples in the table show the classification for:
a plant, lemon-scented myrtle
an animal, the platypus.

Ornithorhynchus anatinus belongs to the Ornithorhynchidae family. The elusive
O. anatinus can be spotted in the riparian zone of our freshwater rivers.

Scientific names often have Latin endings
The scientific names of plants and animals often derive from Latin. Check the spelling when
you use them.
It can help to recognise spelling patterns:
The family names of plants usually end in ‘ceaeʼ.07/09/2024, 13:57 Plants and animals | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/plants-and-animals 7/12The family names of animals usually end in ‘idaeʼ.
All classification names above genus level are in roman type and take initial capitals.
Scientific names can include the name of a person
Technical content often includes the name of the person who first described the species.
The person's name follows the first mention of the species in the content. The publishing
date of the description can also follow the name.
The name and date, if they are included, appear in roman type.
There is a standard form for writing the personʼs name. In this example, ‘F.Muell.ʼ is a
standard abbreviation in biology – it uses full stops and has no spaces. Check a biology
dictionary if you are not certain.
Plants and animals are sometimes allocated to a different genus from the one they were
given when they were first described. In this case, the name and date appear in parentheses
after the genus and species name.Example
Ornithorhynchus anatinus belongs to the Ornithorhynchidae family.
Example
Backhousia citriodora is in the family Myrtaceae.
Ornithorhynchus anatinus is in the order Monotremata.
Example
Grevillea victoriaeF.Muell. was first described by botanist Ferdinand von Mueller.
Example
Robshelfordia circumducta(Walker, 1869)
[This shows that Walker first described the cockroach in 1869 as a species, but another
author has since allocated it to the genus Robshelfordia.]07/09/2024, 13:57 Plants and animals | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/plants-and-animals 8/12Subcategories of species are usually abbreviated
For plants, there are 5 taxonomic categories below species level:
subspecies (abbreviated as 'subsp.' for a single subspecies and 'subspp.' for more than
one subspecies)
variety (abbreviated as 'var.')
subvariety (abbreviated as 'subvar.')
form (abbreviated as 'f.')
subform (abbreviated as 'subf.')
The abbreviations are in roman type and lower case. The subspecies and varietal names
themselves are in italics.
If the species or variety is unknown or unspecified, there is no word after the abbreviation.
For animals, there is only one taxonomic level below that of species: subspecies. By
convention, the abbreviation ‘subsp.ʼ is not used.Example
Grevillea victoriaesubsp. nivalis is one of the subspecies of this Grevillea genus.
Grevillea banksiivar. fosteri has beautiful blood-red flowers.
Example
Grevillea victoriae subsp.
Grevillea banksii var.

Ships, aircraft and other vehicles
Ships, aircraft and other vehicles
Names of ships, aircraft and other vehicles follow a set style. Using the correct
style helps people identify the names of vehicles in text.
Italicise specific names and use capitals
Write the names of individual ships, aircraft and other vehicles:
in italics
with initial capitals.
This makes the name of the ship, aircraft or other vehicle clear. The name contrasts with the
rest of the sentence.
Don't use the definite article for navy ships.
Example
HMAS Canberra is the Royal Australian Navyʼs flagship.
Australian–American astronaut Andy Thomas flew his first flight in space aboard the
Endeavour.
The Indian Pacific travels 4,532 kilometres from Perth to Sydney.07/09/2024, 13:58 Ships, aircraft and other vehicles | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/ships-aircraft-and-other-vehicles 1/5Accessibility requirements
Screen readers donʼt pronounce italics. Use the semantic tag <em> to provide
emphasis for italicised names in HTML.
Names in citations
Separate the names of vehicles from titles in citations and reference lists (/node/181).
Separate them according to the type of publication:
If the title is in italics (such as in book and website titles), use roman type for the name
of the vehicle.
If the title is in roman type (such as a journal article), use italics for the name of the
vehicle.
Donʼt write brands or types of vehicles in
italics
Begin the names of the brands, models and classes of vehicles with an initial capital letter
but donʼt use italics.Example

generic name only if it starts a sentence.
Donʼt italicise the definite article (the word ‘theʼ) before the vehicleʼs name unless it is part of
the name.
Donʼt put the abbreviated parts of a shipʼs name in italics.
Donʼt use italics for the shipʼs class name. Example

Topographic terms
Topographic terms
Correct capitalisation helps people identify topographic and geographic terms
in your content. Refer to landmark features, regions and compass points
correctly.
Write official names with capitals
Check official place names and style them correctly (/node/134). You can check the spelling
of an official name using the Australian Place Names dataset
(https://placenames.fsdf.org.au/).
The full names of mountains, rivers, valleys, bays, islands and other features always take
initial capitals.
Some shortened forms that are popular names or nicknames are also capitalised.Example
the Hunter Valley
the Three Sisters
the Paroo River07/09/2024, 13:58 Topographic terms | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/topographic-terms 1/7Write generic terms in lower case
In most cases, donʼt use initial capitals when you use the name as a generic term.
When using the same generic term for 2 or more names in the same sentence, use lower
case for the generic term.
Keep the initial capital when the general term is a well-recognised abbreviation and works as
a proper name.
Donʼt use an initial capital if youʼre using the noun in a generic sense.Example
The Snowy Mountains can also be called the ‘Snowiesʼ.
The northern part of the Northern Territory is known as the ‘Top Endʼ.
Example
I paddled a kayak 200 km down the Balonne River. The river was in flood for some of the
trip.
Example
The Barossa and Hunter valleys are important winemaking areas. [The word ‘valleyʼ
refers to both valleys. Itʼs used generically and does not take an initial capital.]
The Barossa Valley is in South Australia and the Hunter Valley is in New South Wales.
[The word ‘valleyʼ is part of the name of each valley and so is capitalised.]
Example
The Great Barrier Reef is also called ‘the Reefʼ.
The Gulf of Carpentaria is also known as ‘the Gulfʼ.07/09/2024, 13:58 Topographic terms | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/names-and-terms/topographic-terms 2/7Limit abbreviated names
‘Mtʼis a common and easily recognisable abbreviation for mountains. Use the abbreviation
consistently in content and use initial capitals.
Spell out the names of other topographic features if you can. Use the abbreviated form only
where thereʼs limited space or a lot of repetition, such as in tables and maps.
Use Geoscience Australiaʼs authorised abbreviations
(http://www.ga.gov.au/mapspecs/topographic/v6/section2.html#AuthorisedAbbreviations).
Donʼt use an apostrophe for possessive
names
Donʼt use an apostrophe for topographic terms involving possessives. Official place names
are not possessive and do not usually include punctuation.Example
The Amazon rainforest is vital to the health of our planet. [The ‘Amazon rainforestʼ is not
the official name of the region. The word ‘rainforestʼ is generic and doesnʼt need an
initial capital.]
Example
Mt Tennent is part of Namadgi National Park.
Example

(/node/134#check_official_place_names_and_style_them_correctly).
Spell the plural form correctly
The plural of any topographic name is formed simply by adding ‘sʼ or ‘esʼ.
Write compass points in lower case 
In text, write the points of a compass in lower case. Use hyphens for points such as ‘north-
eastʼ.Correct

Academics and professionals
Academics and professionals
Follow these rules to address and title academics and professionals correctly.
The guidance focuses on academics, medical practitioners, dentists and
veterinarians. Apply the rules when writing about individuals in other
professions.
Use initial capitals for the titles of
individual academics and professionals
The academic and professional titles held by individuals usually have initial capitals. This
includes honorary titles.
Use lower case if you use a title generically.
Example
Adjunct Professor Monty Chiratte [Honorary academic title]
All general surgeons at the hospital attended Wednesdayʼs forum. [Generic use]07/09/2024, 13:58 Academics and professionals | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-address/academics-and-professionals 1/15Use full titles in certain contexts
Academics and professionals are often addressed by their ‘full titleʼ. A full title includes the
title or honorific (with initial capitals), name, post-nominals, position and organisation.
Use a full title:
to introduce an individual as speaker
in address and signature blocks in correspondence
in official records of proceedings
in lists in organisational publications such as annual reports
if it is important to know where an individual works.
A full title is often about using titles in a display or presentation context (display text).
Titles immediately before a name
Use initial capitals for titles that appear immediately before a personʼs name. Do this unless
the title is generic.
Also use initial capitals for the shortened forms (https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-
punctuation-and-conventions/shortened-words-and-phrases) of titles.Example
Professor Deborah Terry AC, Vice-Chancellor and President, University of Queensland
[Full title]
Example
Our new vice-chancellor and president is Professor Rufus Black.
We welcome Dr Jamilah Mulyadi to our clinic. Dr Mulyadi is now available for skin
examinations.07/09/2024, 13:58 Academics and professionals | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-address/academics-and-professionals 2/15Shortened forms for titles immediately before a name
Only use shortened forms of titles in limited circumstances. People might understand
common contractions like ‘Profʼ for ‘Professorʼ, but some shortened forms are confusing. For
example, the initialism for ‘Pro Vice-Chancellorʼ is ‘PVCʼ. To ensure your content is readable,
write the title in full.
Shortened forms are sometimes necessary because of limited space. For example,
shortened forms often appear in tables. List the full form of any title that people might find
confusing in a note (https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-
content/tables#add_notes_to_provide_sources_or_help_interpret_the_data).
The space available for image captions can be limited, but write the full names and titles as a
default. If you have to use initials and the shortened forms of titles in a caption, always
include the full forms in body text to provide context.
‘Drʼ is an exception in all instances. Like ‘Msʼ and ‘Mrʼ, ‘Drʼ is easy to understand when it
appears before a name.
Titles that replace a name
Use initial capitals for official titles that replace a name.
Titles replacing a name also have initial capitals:
when you address someone directly
for salutations in correspondence.Example
Departmental officers recently attended Upsilon Universityʼs annual Copyright
Symposium. The academic panel (pictured below), chaired by Vice-Chancellor Tom
Dhillon, discussed recent cases with implications for fair dealing provisions of the
Copyright Act 1968. [Body text: spelt-out titles]

Nieminen [Image caption: only for limited space]07/09/2024, 13:58 Academics and professionals | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-address/academics-and-professionals 3/15For all other uses, titles that replace a name should be lower case.
These other uses include abbreviated titles and titles given by an organisation to a role or
position. Academic and professional organisations might capitalise such titles as a mark of
respect or status, but this is not Australian Government style
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/punctuation-and-
capitalisation#follow_the_guidance_on_capitals_for_titles_and_government_terms). Treat
them as generic and use lower case.
Titles after a name
Use lower case for most titles that appear after a name. These titles describe the individual
and are generic.
There is one exception. Only use initial capitals for titles after a name in a full title.
This includes for:
address and signature blocks in correspondence
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/format-writing-and-structure/content-formats/emails-
and-letters)
lists in organisational publications such as annual reports.
Follow your organisationʼs template style for signature blocks. Templates apply design
elements and list all elements in correct order. Some organisations prefer all capitals for
names, titles and the organisationʼs name.Example
The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Tasmania visited last week. [Initial capitals:
official title replacing name]
The vice-chancellor visited Burnie campus last week. [Lower case: abbreviated title
replacing name]
Dear Chancellor [Initial capital: salutation]
‘We note your concerns Doctor. Thank you for bringing this evidence before the
committeeʼ. [Initial capital: direct address]07/09/2024, 13:58 Academics and professionals | Style Manual

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-address/academics-and-professionals 5/15Use lower case for titles used in a
generic way
Generic use of academic and professional titles includes:
titles that describe a named individual
plural titles
common nouns.
As shown in the previous section, most titles that appear after a name are generic.
Some titles appearing immediately before a name are also generic because they describe
the individual. These titles are usually preceded by ‘theʼ or a modifier. Adjectives are
modifiers because they restrict the meaning of a noun.
Example
Professor Bartlett, the universityʼs vice-chancellor, welcomed alumni to the reception.
[Lower case: descriptive title after a name]
The research fellow Lydia Mbegngue wrote extensively on this topic. [Lower case: title
before a name, modified by ‘theʼ]
Several postdoctoral fellows in the research facility met last week. [Lower case: plural
title]
A provost oversees a universityʼs academic performance. [Lower case: common noun]
Dhriti Saxena is a local doctor in general practice. [Lower case: common noun and
descriptive title after a name]
They met with former medical director Tom Perera. [Lower case: title immediately before
a name, modified by ‘formerʼ]
Two doctors from this practice attended the conference. [Lower case: plural title]
It is important to see your doctor to develop an asthma action plan. [Lower case:
common noun]07/09/2024, 13:58 Academics and professionals | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-address/academics-and-professionals 6/15Use title, name and post-nominals at
first mention
When you write about an individual, itʼs respectful to use their title.
The first time you mention someone in body text, use their academic or professional title
before their first name and last name, followed by post-nominals.
If you mention the individual again, only use the title and last name. Some academic titles
have an accepted abbreviated title you can use after the first mention.
Never use the shortened form of the title in body text (‘Profʼ for example), except for the
contraction ‘Drʼ.
Write post-nominals after the name in
academic and professional titles
Post-nominals are letters after a name that stand for academic, civil and military awards and
honours (https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/style-rules-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-
address/awards-and-honours).Example
Emeritus Professor Stephen Duckett has extensive experience in health care at senior
leadership level. Professor Duckettʼs membership of the RMIT Council concludes in
2022.
[‘Professorʼ is the accepted abbreviated title for an Emeritus or Emerita Professor.]
Write this
This yearʼs graduate cohort asked Deputy Vice-Chancellor Jonquil Johansson to
moderate their debate.
Not this
DVC Jonquil Johansson to moderate their debate.07/09/2024, 13:58 Academics and professionals | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-address/academics-and-professionals 7/15Make sure you write post-nominals in the right order (https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/style-
rules-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-address/awards-and-
honours#use_postnominals_in_the_correct_order).
Donʼt use commas before or between post-nominals.
Use post-nominals at first mention only
The first time you write a name in body text, use the academic and professional title along
with the first and last name. Include the post-nominal for a civil or military honour in the title.
If you mention the name again, use the title and last name, but donʼt include the post-
nominal.
Include post-nominals in the shortened forms of titles
Retain any post-nominals for civil and military honours when using the shortened forms of
titles.
Use post-nominals for academic and professional
qualifications in 2 contexts
Post-nominals can also stand for tertiary and professional qualifications.
Use these post-nominals:Example
Professor Sally Wheeler OBE MRIA FAcSS FAAL
Example
Dr Ziggy Switkowski AO has been chancellor of RMIT since 2011. Dr Switkowski is also
chair of NBN Co.
Example
Attendees: Dr Z Switkowski AO, Prof M Bean CBE, Dr S Andrews, Ms J Latchford, Prof S
Duckett, Ms T McLaughin and Mr D Hoogstra. [Extract from minutes of a university
council meeting]07/09/2024, 13:58 Academics and professionals | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-address/academics-and-professionals 8/15for correspondence within the academic community
to show relevant expertise.
Donʼt include both ‘Drʼ (doctorate) and ‘PhDʼ (Doctor of Philosophy) for the one name. It is
conventional to use either the title or the post-nominal. This also applies to PhD equivalents
such as ‘LLDʼ (Doctor of Laws).
Donʼt include post-nominals for master and bachelor degrees in correspondence.
Titles for academics
In most contexts, address academics with their full title: title or honorific, name, position,
post-nominals and academic institution.Example
Dr Zdenka Svoboda or Zdenka Svoboda PhD [Individual with doctorate]
Dr Amin Salke MD FRACGP [Medical practitioner]
Brent Hulot CPA [Accountant]
Mark Price BEngTech TMIEAust [Engineer]
Mia Lillard BCom CFP [Financial planner]
Example
Associate Professor Peter Spencer, College of Science, Health, Engineering and
Education, Murdoch University [Full title]
Distinguished Professor Larissa Behrendt AO
Director of Research
Jumbunna Institute for Indigenous Education and Research
University of Technology Sydney
PO Box 123
Broadway NSW 2007
Australia    [Full title: address block]07/09/2024, 13:58 Academics and professionals | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-address/academics-and-professionals 9/15An academic who is knighted
Use ‘Sirʼ or ‘Dameʼ after the academic title.
Emails and letters to academics
Keep the initial capital for the title in correspondence when youʼre writing to a specific
person.
In formal correspondence:
Open with ‘Chancellorʼ (or ‘Vice-Chancellorʼ, ‘Professorʼ and so on).
Conclude with ‘Yours faithfullyʼ.
In less formal correspondence:
Open with ‘Dear Chancellorʼ (or ‘Vice-Chancellorʼ, ‘Professorʼ and so on).
Conclude with ‘Yours sincerelyʼ.
Donʼt include a comma after these phrases. Australian Government style is to write
salutations without punctuation.Example
Chancellor Dame Leonie Kramer AC DBE
Chancellor Sir Albert Axon KBE
Write this
Dear Associate Professor … Yours faithfully
Dear Assistant Professor … Yours sincerely
Not this
Dear Associate Professor, … Yours faithfully,
Dear Assistant Professor, … Yours sincerely,07/09/2024, 13:58 Academics and professionals | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-address/academics-and-professionals 10/15How to address associate and assistant professors correctly in correspondence differs by
country and educational institution.
For Australian correspondence, write ‘Dear Associate Professorʼ and ‘Dear Assistant
Professorʼ not ‘Dear Doctorʼ or ‘Dear Professorʼ.
People with doctorates
You can address people who hold a doctorate as ‘Doctorʼ or ‘Drʼ (without a full stop). Today,
it is acceptable to use ‘Dear Dr Nameʼ for both formal and informal correspondence.
When writing ‘Dearʼ without the personʼs name in emails and letters, write the title ‘Doctorʼ
in full.
Donʼt include a comma after these phrases.
A holder of a doctorate who is knighted
If the holder of a doctorate is knighted, donʼt address them as ‘Doctorʼ.
Instead, address the person by ‘Sirʼ or ‘Dameʼ. Write the post-nominals for the knighthood
after the name, followed by any other post-nominals. Donʼt insert commas before or
between the post-nominals.
Titles for medical practitioners, dentists
and veterinarians
Use ‘Doctorʼ or ‘Drʼ for medical practitioners, dentists and veterinarians, whether or not they
hold a doctorate. Those with a doctorate may choose to add the post-nominal ‘PhDʼ.Example
Dear Dr Muecke
Dear Doctor
Example
Dame Bridget Ogilvie AC DBE FRS FAA07/09/2024, 13:58 Academics and professionals | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-address/academics-and-professionals 11/15Use ‘Professorʼ, ‘Associate Professorʼ or ‘Assistant Professorʼ for doctors who hold these
titles at academic institutions. Some doctors who hold professorships choose to use ‘Drʼ
when working in clinical practice.
Surgeons in human medicine are traditionally called ‘Mrʼ, ‘Msʼ or their preferred gender-
appropriate honorific. Some surgeons prefer to use ‘Drʼ. For example, a search of the website
of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons shows that council members use ‘Drʼ, ‘Missʼ,
‘Mrʼ, ‘Msʼ, ‘Professorʼ and ‘Associate Professorʼ.
It is best to contact the doctorʼs practice if you are unsure of their preferred honorific. You
are unlikely to cause offence if you use the title (or honour) awarded most recently.

Use the correct title and style to refer to members of the armed services. This
guidance is intended primarily for users outside the Department of Defence and
the Australian Defence Force.
Use terminology correctly
Use the term ‘Defenceʼ when you mean both the Department of Defence and the Australian
Defence Force (ADF). ‘Defenceʼ is used to represent the organisation as a whole.
‘Defenceʼ has an initial capital when it is part of a formal name or title
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/types-
words/nouns#proper_nouns_are_the_names_of_people_and_specific_things). Use lower
case for generic references.
Use ‘Australian Defence Forceʼ and ‘ADFʼ when referring to the Royal Australian Navy,
Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force, commanded by the Chief of the Defence
Force (https://www.defence.gov.au/about/leaders/chief-defence-force).
Use ‘Department of Defenceʼ when referring to the department, headed by the Secretary of
the Department of Defence (https://www.defence.gov.au/about/leaders/secretary).07/09/2024, 13:58 Australian Defence Force | Style Manual

arms of the ADF
There are 3 arms of the ADF, known collectively as the ‘servicesʼ (‘Servicesʼ inside Defence).
When referring to the services, follow the order of precedence established by the Defence
Act 1903 (https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2021C00371):
Royal Australian Navy
Australian Army
Royal Australian Air Force.
Always use initial capitals when writing the short names of the services:

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-address/australian-defence-force 3/17Only one rank has a hyphen
Write military ranks of more than one word as separate words. Do not hyphenate the rank.
There is one exception from the Air Force: Air Vice-Marshal. It is always hyphenated.
Post-nominals
Post-nominals are letters after a name that stand for academic, civil and military awards and
honours (https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/style-rules-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-
address/awards-and-honours).
Write post-nominals after the family name. Place post-nominals before the shortened form
showing service (‘RANʼ).
Make sure you write post-nominals in the right order (https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/style-
rules-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-address/awards-and-
honours#use_postnominals_in_the_correct_order).
Donʼt use commas before or between post-nominals.
Use ‘RANʼ to indicate Navy service for commissioned
officers
Use ‘RANʼ (Royal Australian Navy) for all commissioned officers of the Navy. Place ‘RANʼ
after the family name and any post-nominals.Example
Acting Sub Lieutenant DW Midson RAN
Warrant Officer Class One K Felmingham NSC OAM
Air Vice-Marshal Catherine Roberts AM CSC
Example
Commander Algirdus Diciunas MBE CSM RAN
Lieutenant General Natasha Fox AO CSC
Air Commodore Michael Kitcher AM DSC07/09/2024, 13:58 Australian Defence Force | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-address/australian-defence-force 4/17Donʼt use an acronym to show service for officers in the Army or Air Force.
In Defence, ‘RANʼ is used to distinguish naval officers from officers in the other services and
from naval officers in other countries.
Gazettal notices of Australian awards and honours follow this style. For consistency, the
Style Manual recommends that Australian Government organisations also follow this
practice.
Write the rank before the title of ADF members who are
knighted
When someone has a military rank and another title such as ‘Sirʼ, ‘Dameʼ or ‘the Honourableʼ,
place the military rank first.
Address chaplains and maritime spiritual
wellbeing officers by title
Army and Air Force chaplains wear military rank.
Navy chaplains and maritime spiritual wellbeing officers (MSWOs) do not wear military rank.
Instead, they wear chaplaincy or MWSO insignia and a service badge with the symbol of
their faith or purpose. This gives them ‘floating rankʼ, meaning they take on the rank of the
person they are talking to.
Address chaplains with their chaplaincy title, not a military rank.
MSWOs have been part of the Navy since 2020. Address them with their MSWO title, not a
military rank.Example
Captain Catherine Wilsen AO [Army]
Captain Stephen Beckmann AO CSC RAN [Navy]
Example
General Sir John Monash GCMG KBE VD07/09/2024, 13:58 Australian Defence Force | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-address/australian-defence-force 5/17Include any post-nominals.
The chaplaincy titles are:
Principal Chaplain (Navy and Army) and Principal Air Chaplain (Air Force)
Senior Chaplain (Navy) and Chaplain (Navy, Army and Air Force).
The MSWO titles include:
Principal Maritime Spiritual Wellbeing Officer
Senior Maritime Spiritual Wellbeing Officer
Maritime Spiritual Wellbeing Officer.
Address retired officers of the ADF by
rank
Commissioned officers who retire can continue to use their military rank. When writing their
name, use their rank and include ‘(Retd)ʼ after any post-nominals.Example
Principal Chaplain Darren Jaensch [Army]
Principal Air Chaplain Kevin Russell CSC GAICD [Air Force]
Senior Chaplain Brian Rayner OAM RAN [Navy]
Chaplain Catherine Inches-Ogden CSC [Army]
Maritime Spiritual Wellbeing Officer Tammy Dunne [Navy]
Example
General the Honourable Sir Peter Cosgrove AK CVO MC (Retd)07/09/2024, 13:58 Australian Defence Force | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions/titles-honours-forms-address/australian-defence-force 6/17Avoid using the shortened forms of
ranks
For internal Defence use, it is common to write the ranks in abbreviated form using capital
letters.
Donʼt follow this convention in other types of content. Write the full rank with an initial capital
letter.
Address members of the ADF correctly in
emails and letters
The style rule for address blocks applies to all members of the ADF.
The style rule for salutations changes with rank.
Address blocks
To write an address block, follow all preceding rules on this page.
The style of address blocks is the same for all ranks.

guidance about maritime spiritual wellbeing officers.
The sixth edition had a table of armed service ranks in Australia. The digital edition has a

Awards and honours
Post-nominals and titles of status show the awards and honours an individual
has. List them in the correct order.
Use post-nominals in the correct order
Post-nominals are the shortened forms for academic awards and civil and military honours.
There is an order in which to write the post-nominals (https://www.pmc.gov.au/resource-
centre/government/post-nominals).
In summary, the rule is to write the highest honour first. The order is:
post-nominals for honours and awards
Kingʼs Counsel (KC) or Senior Counsel (SC) or Justice of the Peace (JP)
university degrees and diplomas
membership of professional associations
membership of parliament.

Follow these rules to address and title people correctly.

members
(https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Contacting_Senators_and_Members/How
_to_address_Senators_and_Members).
Write these titles as follows:
the Prime Minister
the President of the Senate
the Speaker of the House of Representatives
ministers (Senate)
ministers (House of Representatives)
assistant ministers (Senate)
assistant ministers (House of Representatives)
senators
members (House of Representatives).
People elected to the upper house take the title ‘Senatorʼ before their given name.In many countries treasurers are preparing responses to this latest development.
[Generic]

Australiaʼs first female prime minister was Julia Gillard, who took office in 2010.
Peter Costello remains the longest-serving treasurer in Australian history.07/09/2024, 13:59 Parliaments and councils | Style Manual

after any other post-nominals. Donʼt use commas before or between post-nominals.
Address certain office holders of the
Australian Parliament as ‘Honourableʼ
Use the title ‘Honourableʼ for ministers (including the prime minister) and parliamentary
secretaries in the Australian Parliament. The title is given to these office holders because
they are members of the Federal Executive Council
(https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and
_procedure/Practice7/HTML/Chapter2/Federal_Executive_Council). They retain the title for
life.
The abbreviation for ‘Honourableʼ is ‘Honʼ without a full stop.

member of the Senate.Example

called the ‘lower houseʼ.

The title of the Kingʼs wife, Queen Camilla, is ‘Her Majesty The Queenʼ.
The title of the late Queen Elizabeth II is ‘Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth IIʼ.
The title of the late Queenʼs husband, Prince Philip, is ‘His Royal Highness The Duke of

Address letters to Prince William to his private secretary. You can use the shortened form
for ‘His Royal Highnessʼ in this instance.
Use an initial capital for ‘Theʼ for the formal titles of the King and his immediate family.
Use regnal numbers (I, II, V) for titles of
monarchs and religious leaders

Put a non-breaking space between the name and the regnal number. A non-breaking space
means that line breaks wonʼt split up both elements of the name. The name and number will
stay together on one line.
You can insert a non-breaking space using the Unicode character U+00A0.
In HTML, use the entity &nbsp; to insert a non-breaking space. You can also use the
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar in Word.
Print considerations
Use a narrow no-break space between the name and the regnal number.
The narrow no-break space ensures that the:
name and number stays together on one line
spacing between name and number doesnʼt change when text is justified.
You can insert a narrow no-break space using the Unicode character U+202F.Rama IX

part of the formal title
The position of governor-general in Australia is known as vice-royalty. The Governor-General
represents the King in Australia.
Address the Governor-General of Australia in the following style and order:
‘His/Her Excellency the Honourableʼ
prefixed titles
given name and family name
post-nominals
‘Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australiaʼ.
You might need to vary the order of the items in the title to suit the titles of the incumbent.
For example, place:
military rank before ‘the Honourableʼ
‘Sirʼ or ‘Dameʼ after ‘the Honourableʼ.
When you are referring to the generic term, use lower case ‘governor-generalʼ. When you are
referring to 2 or more people who hold or have held the title, use lower case and refer to
them as ‘governors-generalʼ.Example
His Excellency General the Honourable David Hurley AC DSC (Retd), Governor-General
of the Commonwealth of Australia

Blogs
Blog posts can help users solve common problems. Use clear structures and
ensure content is accessible. Moderate comments if you allow them.
Find out if a blog will meet a user need
Create a blog if it will help people find and use government services and products.
Before starting a blog, do user research (/node/76). Find out if people will use the blog and
why.
Blogs can support user needs by:
detailing one aspect of a service or product
giving information about policy issues
highlighting innovations, research and best practice
inviting feedback.
Donʼt use blogs for essential information that should be stand-alone content. Donʼt duplicate
information thatʼs available elsewhere.
Things to consider before starting a blog include:Example
Curious about what goes on at the museum? These blogs give you an inside peek. [Blog
posts focus on aspects of a service.]07/09/2024, 13:59 Blogs | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/blogs 1/8What do users want to know about your organisationʼs services?
Does a blog fit with your organisationʼs content strategy?
What will a blog add that users canʼt find elsewhere?
How will a blog fit with your organisationʼs goals and its communications strategy?
Would it be useful to allow comments, and do you have the dedicated staff to monitor
them?
Plan blog posts with a specific purpose
and structure
Update the blog regularly. For example, aim for a new post once a week on the same day. But
make sure you have something useful to say.
A blog post should solve usersʼ problems or answer their questions. Common places you can
find information on these include:
user research
search logs
call centre and shopfront data
social media
web analytics
surveys.
Titles, headings and text
Help users find the information they need by following the guidance for:
headings (/node/51)
paragraphs (/node/53)
links (/node/193)
lists (/node/56)
search engine optimisation (/node/103).
Start with a title that helps users understand what the post is about. Include keywords
(/node/72). Avoid clickbait titles.07/09/2024, 13:59 Blogs | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/blogs 2/8Break up your post with headings and short paragraphs. Order headings from most to least
important. Cover one main idea per paragraph. Keep paragraphs to a maximum of 2 to 3
sentences so people can read them on mobile devices.
Use a warm and conversational tone in your blog posts. This will help you engage with the
people reading the blog.
Accessibility requirements
User needs:
I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.
I can change the content's presentation without losing information or structure.
I can easily control how I see and hear distinctions if sound and colour convey
meaning.
Fundamentals:
Write clear page titles. This is the first thing a screen reader user will hear and
should align with the first heading on the page.Write this

Copyright requirements
You must get permission (a licence) to use copyright material. This includes images,
video and audio.
Some material is available under an open access licence, such as Creative Commons
(https://creativecommons.org.au/).
Read the government copyright rules in the Australian Government intellectual
property manual (https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/media-
centre/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).
Privacy requirements
Your organisation has obligations under the Privacy Act 1988
(https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/).
Privacy is relevant whenever it's possible to identify someone. Treat things that can or
might identify an individual as personal information. A blog might feature someone's
picture as an image or in a video, for example.07/09/2024, 13:59 Blogs | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/blogs 5/8When you handle personal information, you must comply with the Australian Privacy
Principles (https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/). Personal
information is any information that could identify an individual, in any format.
Call to action
Include a call to action at the end of your post. Examples of calls to action include invitations
to:
take the next step in using the service or product
give feedback
get emails about new posts or news items
subscribe to a newsletter
get more detailed information on a topic
respond to a survey.
Promotion
Promote your blog post on social media (/node/43). Tailor content to suit each platform.
Manage comments if you decide to allow
them
Blogs can encourage dialogue with people who use government services and products. 
There are benefits in allowing comments. If you involve readers by publishing their
comments, they are more likely to return to the blog. By responding to comments, you can
increase engagement with the content.
Allowing comments on blogs also has a downside. Comments sections often attract trivial or
hostile responses. You will need to moderate comments before publishing them.Example
To bookmark the topics you find most useful, visit the Style Manual
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/).07/09/2024, 13:59 Blogs | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/blogs 6/8Government blogs are official communication channels and speak for the government, so
those who reply need to have the authority to make official comments.
A blog that allows comments needs dedicated moderators. It can become unmanageable if
there are many comments.
Social media has mostly replaced blogs for the purpose of encouraging comments.
Information management requirements
Blogs that you create for the Australian Government become records. Records
provide evidence of what your organisation has done and why. 
Managing and disposing of records properly is a requirement under the Archives Act
1983 (https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02796). You must follow your
organisationʼs information management requirements. Visit the National Archives of
Australia website for information management standards

Easy Read
Easy Read combines text with layout and imagery to simplify and explain
information. Users often print Easy Read materials. The standard layout works
as a handout.
Create Easy Read to broaden access
The aim of Easy Read is to give more people access to information.
Easy Read is a way to present information for people who are not familiar with English, or
who have low literacy or learning disability (/node/69).
Easy Readʼs unique layout and style presents information so itʼs easy to understand. The
content can explain complex information about law, policy or obligations. 
Easy Read often involves using images to complement the text. It can be a good basis for
translating content into other languages.
Identify user needs
Before starting, make sure you do research with people who will use the information. Find
out how they will access the materials – in print, online or with support from others.
Not everyone will find Easy Read useful: check the findings from your user research
(/node/76). You might find people prefer other formats, such as video or a webpage.07/09/2024, 13:59 Easy Read | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/easy-read 1/10Engage Easy Read experts
It is best to engage Easy Read experts. They will know how to research and communicate
with specific user groups.
They will also have expertise on design. Easy Read professionals are experienced in
connecting language and imagery to help users understand and consume information. 
Design and publish materials to
download
Design your Easy Read materials as a printed handout to be used by people in several
scenarios. For example, employers, support workers, family or carers might use the materials
to talk something through with people who need to use the information.
Make Easy Read materials available in addition to any source material they are derived from.
Publish them in HTML and as an accessible PDF at the same time as the source material.
Users need to be able to print or download the Easy Read version from the same site as the
source material.
Print considerations
Publishing Easy Read as a PDF means it may be read online or printed. When you have
links in the materials, you need to:
provide clear link text and make sure it looks like a link
spell out the URL next to the linked text.
Accessibility considerations
User needs:
I can follow the design, structure and language of the content.
Fundamentals:07/09/2024, 13:59 Easy Read | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/easy-read 2/10Follow W3C updates on making content usable for people with cognitive and
learning disabilities (https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/). 
Make the structure of Easy Read PDFs accessible to help people who will need
to download them from the website.
Make all government content accessible to people with disability. This includes
providing information that is timely, which is part of Australian law under the
Disability Discrimination Act 1992

Plan the structure
Think of the Easy Read version as a summary of the source material. This helps you plan the
structure and determine the level of detail to include.
Identify the main points to cover and decide how to explain them. Include examples
throughout to help explain ideas and concepts.
Your research will help you decide if you need images. Ask your Easy Read expert to help
you choose images users can relate to and understand. Users will be drawn to the images
first to derive meaning, before looking at the adjacent text.07/09/2024, 13:59 Easy Read | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/easy-read 3/10Keep text simple
Easy Read follows some plain language principles – such as using simple words and
sentences – but Easy Read and plain language are different.
Differences between Easy Read and plain language
Easy Read Plain language
Focus is on simplicity Focus is on clarity
Text and images carry the meaning Text carries the meaning
Large font size Standard font size
Often, another person reads the content to the
intended userContent is read by the intended
user
Check your content reads between a year 4 to year 6 reading level. Use simple words and
grammar, but donʼt use childish language if the users are adults.
Difficult words
Some important words might be hard for people to read and understand. A difficult word
might have 3 or more syllables.
If you need to use a difficult word, write it in bold.
Define the difficult word in the next sentence or phrase.
If you have defined a lot of words, include a glossary at the end of your document. Call
it a word list.
Example07/09/2024, 13:59 Easy Read | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/easy-read 4/10Avoid questions in the text
Only use questions in headings for Easy Read. Questions in the text can make some people
anxious. They might feel that they have to answer and worry about how to respond.
If you need information from people, follow questions with practical examples so people
know how to respond. Ask your Easy Read professional to help you design these materials.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/easy-read 5/10Involve others as you draft
Involve people from your target user group as you write, design and test the materials. They
can help you to choose imagery and to use terms they use themselves.
Ask your Easy Read professional to help you find or create images that convey meaning.
When you finish the draft, check with the original author to make sure you have the meaning
right.
Keep your Easy Read brief. This is not always possible for complex information. In that case,
think about whether you can divide the content into a few documents. Check if this decision
will meet user needs.
Information management requirements
Content that you create as part of your work for the Australian Government is a
record. Records provide evidence of what your organisation has done and why.
Managing and disposing of records is required under the Archives Act 1983
(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02796). For guidance, visit the National
Archives of Australiaʼs information management standards
(https://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/information-management-
standards).
Follow a standard Easy Read layout
Easy Read layout creates a relationship between images and text.
Use a consistent layout and minimum design elements so itʼs easy for people to use or
explain. Your agency might have an Easy Read publishing template. Find out before using a
table grid to format images and text.
Tables help to align images and words. If you use them, follow accessibility requirements for
tables (/node/45). When designing the Easy Read material, code tables using the
role="presentation" attribute (https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-wai-aria-1.1-
20171214/#presentation).
In a standard Easy Read layout:07/09/2024, 13:59 Easy Read | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/easy-read 6/10Use wide margins and plenty of white space to make the text easy to read.
Use at least 1.5 line spacing.
If youʼre using images, place them on the left to align with the text on the right.
Donʼt put images above the text or vice versa.
Left-align the text.
To format text:
Use at least size 14 font for text and a larger size for headings.
Only use bold for headings and difficult words.
Be careful using text effects – any change to the shape of letters makes them more
difficult to read.
Use colour and contrast to make words stand out, but donʼt rely on colour to convey
meaning.
Print considerations
Donʼt split paragraphs and sentences across pages in print and PDF documents.
Insert page numbers in print and PDF documents, in the same font size as your
text.
Use matte paper stock: it reduces glare off the page.
Include your agency or department logo on the cover page only.
Provide context
Users need to understand the reason for the material, how to use it and how to find out
more.
At the beginning of the content:
introduce your organisation
explain how to use it – images with text, difficult words and links
add words to reassure people that itʼs okay to ask someone else to help them read it
explain how the Easy Read relates to other content – as a summary or guide
provide a URL or a hyperlink to the standard version (for digital content)07/09/2024, 13:59 Easy Read | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/easy-read 7/10include a list of contents if there are several pages.
At the end, add:
where people can find more information
a word list if there are a lot of difficult words
‘contact usʼ information.
You might add:
a word count
information about other services
other resources.

Emails and letters
Concise letters and emails tell a recipient what they need to know. Use the right
level of formality for the recipient and purpose. Be mindful of peopleʼs privacy.
Identify the user and purpose
The user (recipient) and the purpose determine whether you use an email or a letter.
The level of formality in the writing depends on the recipient and the purpose.
When you write emails or letters for work, use the right format and tone for the purpose.
Users vary. They include:
people outside government
colleagues in the department or agency
colleagues in other departments or agencies.
Consider the kind of relationship that you have with the recipient.
Emails and letters have many purposes. These include:
providing or seeking information
giving advice or requiring action to enforce a law or regulation
taking part in a discussion or negotiation about a topic or issue.07/09/2024, 14:00 Emails and letters | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/emails-and-letters 1/12Assess the formality based on context
and policy
Letters are more formal than emails, but the differences are becoming blurred. Emails are
now used for some formal official correspondence.
The more formal the purpose, the more likely it is that you will use a letter instead of an
email. But the choice is not clear-cut and depends on your organisationʼs preferences. Make
sure you know what they are.
Write in clear language with appropriate
tone
Always write in plain language (/node/55).
Consider the needs of the person who will get the email or letter and choose the right tone
(/node/40).
Access to information requirements
The Freedom of Information Act 1982
(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02562) gives people the right to
request access to government-held information. This includes emails and letters.
If you write in government, the email or letter you write could become public. Emails
and letters can be subject to freedom of information requests. They could also be
used as evidence during legal proceedings.Example
In formal correspondence requiring a person to comply with a law, you would be more
likely to write a letter.
In informal correspondence between colleagues working together, you would be more
likely to use an email.07/09/2024, 14:00 Emails and letters | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/emails-and-letters 2/12Confirm privacy rules before you write to
someone
Take steps to confirm details are up-to-date before sending letters containing personal
information.
Privacy requirements and permissions
Your organisation has obligations under the Privacy Act 1988
(https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/).
When you handle personal information, you must comply with the Australian Privacy
Principles (https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/). Personal
information is any information that could identify an individual, in any format.
You must prevent unintended transmission of personal information via email. Emails
need to be sent securely and to the correct recipient. Check your organisationʼs
processes and procedures for the secure transmission of personal information.
For letters sent by post, consider using registered post. This requires signature on
delivery to ensure the letter is delivered to the correct recipient.
The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner has more guidance in its Guide
to securing personal information (https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/guidance-and-
advice/guide-to-securing-personal-information/).
You must have someoneʼs explicit permission to add them to a mailing list and you
must give them the option to unsubscribe.
Your organisation might also have obligations under the Spam Act 2003
(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A01214). The Australian Communications
and Media Authority can provide guidance about emailing promotional content via a
distribution list (https://www.acma.gov.au/avoid-sending-spam).
Address blocks
Include the recipientʼs name and postal address at the top of the letter. Make sure the
recipientʼs details are correct.
If youʼre sending a letter to someone in an organisation, include:
the recipientʼs position07/09/2024, 14:00 Emails and letters | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/emails-and-letters 3/12the branch or division they work in
the name of the organisation.
Use information only if it is accurate, up to date, complete and relevant. If necessary, contact
a recipient to confirm their address.
Emailed letters
For letters you send electronically:
Consider using secure messaging services like myGov rather than email.
With emails, explain in the covering text that the email has a letter attached.
Electronic letters are more accessible for some people than paper letters. For example, a
person who is blind or has low vision can access electronic documents by using screen-
reading software.
CC and BCC fields
Send emails to people only if they need the information.
Copy people into an email if they need the email for information only.
Include recipients in the ‘Toʼ field only if you need them to act on something in the
email.
Use the ‘CCʼ field if people all know each other or can look up an email address with
ease.
Use the ‘BCCʼ field to send an email to a group of people who donʼt know each other.
Use of BCC protects peopleʼs privacy by not disclosing their name or email address.
Use your organisationʼs letter templates
Use the organisationʼs template for letters. The template will include any branding you need
to use, including letterhead.
Using a template helps the recipient know that the letter is official and that they can trust it.
It is also part of the organisationʼs brand and shows consistency.07/09/2024, 14:00 Emails and letters | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/emails-and-letters 4/12Accessibility requirements
User needs:
I can understand any information contained in an image.
I can read and understand text, even if there are unusual words and shortened
words, or languages other than English.
I can change the content's presentation without losing information or structure.
Fundamentals:
To enable mobile device screen readers to access the file, use an accessible file
format.
For images in emails and digital letters, use alt text (/node/49).
Consider accessibility when sending attachments. For example, donʼt send PDF
attachments if the recipient could be using a mobile device to read the email.
Don't send images unless they're referred to and described in the text.
Make sure any links are easily found and work properly.
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:

Include dates in letters
Include the date you are sending the letter so that the recipient knows when you wrote it.
This is especially important if they need to do something or if you are notifying them of a
decision.07/09/2024, 14:00 Emails and letters | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/emails-and-letters 5/12Write a clear and concise subject line
Be clear and concise with the subject line. It should sum up the purpose of the email.
Write the subject line as a heading that helps people know what is in the email and why they
should read it. As for all headings, it is good practice to put the main idea first. This is
especially helpful when people read emails on smaller screens. A long subject line might not
be displayed in full on smaller screens.
People are more likely to open an email if the subject is clear. It is also easier to find the email
later.
Avoid using expressions and words that make the email look like spam or like a suspicious
email (https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/detecting-socially-
engineered-messages).
A subject in a letter is like a subject line in an email. Itʼs what the recipient will read first and
must make the purpose of the letter very clear.
Keep it short but informative.
Use a salutation and sign-off to match
the formality
The salutation and sign off should match the level of formality.
The most formal salutations are rarely useful. It is best to address a person by their name
and preferred title.Write

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/emails-and-letters 6/12The first email in a conversation should include the recipientʼs name and an appropriate
salutation. Use ‘Dearʼ in a more formal context and ‘Hiʼ in a more informal context, such as
emailing a colleague.
If you donʼt know the recipient for an email or letter, use ‘Dearʼ, the recipientʼs title (Ms, Mr,
Mrs, Mx, Dr) and their last name. 
Use the correct and preferred title for people of different gender identities (/node/64). ‘Mxʼ
refers to non-binary people and those who do not wish to be referred to by their gender. Use
‘Mxʼ when a person indicates this is what they prefer, but not otherwise.
If you do not know the recipientʼs preferred title, you can simply use a personʼs given name
with their family name (/node/59#use_the_terms_given_name_and_family_name).
Follow specific conventions when addressing ministers, royalty, diplomats and other officials
(/node/149).
Be careful of using a shortened name if you arenʼt sure the recipient uses it.
At the end of the letter or email, include a sign-off that matches the salutation. Use ‘Yours
sincerelyʼ if you know the personʼs name. Use ‘Yours faithfullyʼ if you do not.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/emails-and-letters 7/12Structure the body to help the user
Plan what you are going to write. Think about:
who the email or letter is for (the recipient)
why youʼre sending it.
Stay on topic and write only what the recipient needs to know. For emails, send separate
emails about separate topics. It helps keep the conversation clear. It also helps the recipient
find the information later.
Use one idea per paragraph (/node/53). If it will make the email or letter clearer, use
headings (/node/51).
Structure emails and letters so that the recipient knows whatʼs most important as soon as
they open it. Keep the email or letter as short as possible. People will be able to read and
understand it quickly if you omit unnecessary detail.
The body of an email should reflect the subject line. It should tell the recipient:
why youʼre sending the email
what they need to do or understand.
The body of a letter is where you give more details about the subject. Include:
an introduction stating why youʼre sending the letter
what the recipient needs to do or understand
any information the recipient needs to know so they can do what you have asked them
to
a list of extra pages, such as a form
a concluding sentence or paragraph.
Attach only documents that are relevant to the email or letter.
If you include links in emails or electronic letters, make sure theyʼre accessible and check
they work. Do not use URLs in emails or letters. Link a word or phrase so the reader is clear
about where the link will take them.
Check your organisationʼs policy about links in emails and electronic letters. They can look
suspicious to people receiving them.07/09/2024, 14:00 Emails and letters | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/emails-and-letters 8/12Print considerations
Spell out the full URL of any links you use in a letter. This makes it easier for the
recipient to type the URL into their web browser.
If a letter is longer than one page, insert the page breaks in appropriate places so the
recipient doesn't miss information.
Never use an emoji in formal correspondence. Use emojis only when youʼre sure they are
appropriate, and donʼt rely on them for meaning.
Include your signature block
Every email should include a signature block with information about the sender and their
organisation. This could be you or the person or team responsible for the email.
Follow your agencyʼs requirements, which may include your:
name
position or role
branch and division
organisation
work phone number
work email address.
In a letter, when appropriate, add the details of a contact person if there is one. Never
include someoneʼs contact details if you havenʼt asked first.
Check for style and writing errors
Use the organisationʼs style guide or template.
Check the letter or email before sending it, even if itʼs a quick email to a colleague. A
typographical error (‘typoʼ) can mean the recipient has to reply with questions instead of
knowing what to do.07/09/2024, 14:00 Emails and letters | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/emails-and-letters 9/12Follow your organisationʼs rules for
archiving
Follow your workplaceʼs guidelines for record keeping and managing security.
Information management requirements
You must use the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) when preparing
government information. The PSPF covers how information is classified and marked,
and what this means for its storage, handling, access and disposal. Consult the
PSPFʼs guide to sensitive and classified information
(https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/information/sensitive-classified-
information/Pages/default.aspx) or consult your organisationʼs protective security
policy.
Information (including emails and letters) that you create become records. Records
provide evidence of what your organisation has done and why.
Managing and disposing of records properly is a requirement under the Archives Act
1983 (https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02796). You must follow your
organisationʼs information management requirements. Visit the National Archives of
Australia website for information management standards
(https://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/information-management-
standards).

Forms
This guidance helps you to design digital forms filled in by the user. Most of the
guidance also applies to printed forms, but there are some differences noted.
Learn about the user before you design a
form
Find out about users and their needs through user research (/node/76). Understand the user
and their needs before you design any kind of form (web-based or print).
People use forms to access a service and to meet government requirements.
Sometimes a user will need to fill in a form on behalf of another user. Or a public servant
might use a form to record what the user tells them (for example, a statistical survey).
Before you digitise a paper form, make sure you understand the user and business needs.
Work out if a form is even needed.
Find out about language users can relate to
Discover the terms and phrases that people use when they talk about the topic. This
includes the words they use in search engines.
Learn about which words will help the user understand the form.07/09/2024, 14:00 Forms | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/forms 1/24Develop the ‘question protocolʼ first
A ‘question protocolʼ is a document that helps you find out what you need to ask the user. It
lists:
the questions you will ask
why you are collecting information
what you will do with it.
This document makes it easier to collect the information that is actually needed.
A question protocol also gives you a way to challenge and push back against unnecessary
questions. Every time we ask a user for information it costs them and your organisation. It
takes time and effort for the user to provide it, and for your organisation to manage it.
Every question protocol is different, but it should answer all the following questions.
Work out what information you need to collect.
Do you actually need the information? Why?
How much detail do you need?
Can you get the information from somewhere else? (For example, it might already be
collected in your organisation.)
Explore the experience of the user providing the information.
Which users need to give you the information?
How will the user discover or receive the form?
Will the user need to collect information from other people? (For example, a form can
need different people to contribute to it.)
What happens to the user before and after they give you the information?
Are there other times you might be collecting related information?
Plan how you will manage the information you will collect.
How will you check the information is accurate?
What happens if you get the wrong response? What error messages will you need to
provide?
What will you do with the information when you have it?07/09/2024, 14:00 Forms | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/forms 2/24How will you keep the information up to date and secure?
Some of these answers wonʼt inform the design of the form, but will help you manage the
information.
Information management requirements
Your question protocol becomes a record. So does anything you collect from a form.
Records provide evidence of what your organisation has done and why.
Managing and disposing of records properly is a requirement under the Archives Act
1983 (https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02796). For guidance, read about
the National Archives of Australiaʼs information management standards
(https://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/information-management-
standards).
Start with one thing per page then test if
you need to group
Putting one thing on each page helps you see everything you need to find out, without
guessing about the best way to group it.
Begin prototyping with one thing per page over any number of pages:
one piece of information youʼre telling a user
one decision the user has to make
one question the user has to answer.
Each question might have more than one field. An address is one thing that would use
several fields.07/09/2024, 14:00 Forms | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/forms 3/24Having a single thing on each page helps you:
reduce the cognitive load for users
save the userʼs answers as they move through the form
capture analytics about each question
handle branching questions and loops.
Your research with users will help you decide what order to put the questions in. This should
include thinking about which topics are more related to each other, or need to be answered
by a particular user.
This will help you work out if you need to group questions and create sections.
You might find that you do not need to group any questions.
Keep prototyping and testing the structure of the questions until the user can:
understand what youʼre asking them to do
focus on the specific question and its answer
find their way through an unfamiliar process
use the service on a mobile device.Example
One question (one thing): the userʼs birth date
[In a digital form you you would usually ask this question using 3 fields.]07/09/2024, 14:00 Forms | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/forms 4/24Avoid using a progress indicator
If the form is short (for example, 5 questions or fewer with no branching), the user wonʼt
need a progress indicator. Adding the indicator would be extra work that the user might not
even notice.
Itʼs difficult to design an accurate indicator that shows a user their progress through a
complex form.
Complex forms can branch. They might have sections that donʼt apply to some users and
optional questions. This means the user might not move through the form in a predictable
way.
Test adding task list and ‘check your answersʼ pages to
complex forms
If you need to help the user estimate how long it will take to fill in a complex form, test
adding:Example
A group of 2 fields in a website login
[Users often prefer to have username and password questions on the same page.]
Avoid this
A progress indicator for a registration form07/09/2024, 14:00 Forms | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/forms 5/24a task list page at the start
a ‘check your answersʼ page at the end.
Task list pages help users understand the tasks in a transaction and their order.
These pages show the user the tasks they have completed and help them to jump to
incomplete tasks.
A ‘check your answersʼ page summarises the sections of a form. The summary shows the
user what information theyʼve provided.
This step can help users go back and change any responses, or confirm that theyʼre giving
the correct information.Example
Example07/09/2024, 14:00 Forms | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/forms 6/24Write clear questions and headings
When you know how to group the questions, you will be able to create the structure.
Organise content in the form using section headings. Describe the topic or the following
section in the headings.
Write short active content for forms, including ‘help textʼ and error messages – this is called
‘microcopyʼ.
Accessibility requirements
User needs:
I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.
I can change the content's presentation without losing information or structure.

3.3.6. Error prevention (all) – level AAA
(https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#error-prevention-all)
Use familiar words in familiar ways
Write and design forms starting with plain language
(https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/node/194). Include the terms that are familiar to users.
A form can be harder for people to find and use if it does not contain the terms people
expect to be there. Your research with users will identify the terms people use about the
topic.
Test the form with the terms included. If they help the user understand and use the form,
keep them.
If some users donʼt understand the terms, include plain language definitions.
Establish the appropriate voice and tone (/node/40).
Say who the form is for and what they need
Before a user starts a form, they need to know:
what the form is for and if they need to fill it in
who can use the form (if they are eligible for the service)
what they need to submit the form (for example, tax file number and passport number)
if they can ask someone else to fill it in for them
what happens after they submit it and any other stages.07/09/2024, 14:00 Forms | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/forms 8/24If the form is part of a service that will involve other stages, show the full service process
with a task list. Include information about any other forms the user will need to fill in.
Donʼt mark ‘requiredʼ questions – only ask for what you need
You must only collect personal information if it is necessary. Collect the least amount needed
for the function or activity related to the form.
Tell people when and why you are collecting their personal information, and what their
privacy rights are. Use a collection statement on the form.
You donʼt need to mark questions as ‘requiredʼ because you will only be asking for
information that is needed.
Sometimes you need to invite the user to tell you something they think is important and
they want us to know (for example, to collect feedback). Mark these questions as ‘optionalʼ.
Privacy requirements and access to information
When you handle personal information, you must comply with the Australian Privacy
Principles (https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/). Personal
information is any information that could identify an individual, in any format.
People have a right to request access to their personal information under the Privacy
Act 1988 (https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/).
People also have the right to request access to government-held information under
the Freedom of Information Act 1982
(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02562). This includes personal
information collected in a form.
The federal regulator for privacy and freedom of information legislation is the Office of
the Australian Information Commissioner (https://www.oaic.gov.au/).
Keep a single column format
Donʼt use multiple columns in digital forms.
Print considerations07/09/2024, 14:00 Forms | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/forms 9/24Avoid using a second column in print forms.
If you have to use multiple columns, keep the same number throughout the form.
Make sure the columns are visually different (for example, with a thick line between
them).
Splitting information across 2 or more columns can:
add cognitive load for users
slow down users of assistive technology if they miss content
make the form harder to use on mobile devices.
Number the questions
For forms that have more than one question, number the questions.
This is helpful for the user if they need to leave the form and return to it later. It can also
make it easier for them to get help to fill it in, and for them to work across a paper and digital
version.
Choose accessible form inputs
Use the following 3 form inputs. They are the most accessible for users.
If you need the user to:
pick one preferred option, use radio buttons
select one or more options, use checkboxes
write an answer, use a text input (including for numbers).
If you need to use other form inputs, try rewriting the questions to fit these inputs.07/09/2024, 14:00 Forms | Style Manual

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/forms 11/24Set the size of the text input box to the size of the response the user will provide. Your
research will help you work out the right field size.
Print considerations
There is no way for a user to distinguish between radio buttons and check boxes in
print forms. You can include a message to select only one option, but the user might
not read this.
Plan for how you will use the information if the user selects more than one option.
Donʼt disable inputs as it can confuse the user. Only include a question if it is relevant to the
user.
Avoid using select (menu items) and range sliders
Select boxes and range sliders can be very hard for some people to use. This includes
people who experience essential tremor or difficulties with hand control.
Instead of using a select box, ask other questions to reduce options. Then display fewer
options using radio buttons.Text inputs for a postcode, mobile number and address

Buttons in forms help users carry out an action like submitting or saving a form.
Donʼt use a button unless it is a call for action.
The label must clearly describe what happens when the user selects the button. Try to
use one word or a short phrase as a label. Avoid using icons or images.
Accessibility requirements
User needs:
I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.
I can predict the webpage's appearance and how I will operate the content.
I can operate the webpage with something other than a keyboard, like a pointer.
I can avoid making any mistakes with my inputs, and correct any that I might
make.

Use the primary button for the main action
Use a button for the main call to action on the form (for example, ‘Save and nextʼ or ‘Send
applicationʼ).
Position the primary action button in the same place on every page (for example, at the
bottom of the form, aligned with the left side of the input field). This placement makes the
form predictable and easier to use.
Add secondary buttons if there are extra actions
Sometimes you need to use a secondary button for another common action (for example,
‘Save as draftʼ). Make sure the button action matches what it says it does.
Make secondary buttons visually different and less prominent than the primary button.Example

Disabled buttons can confuse some users. Only include them when your research shows
they make the form easier for the user.
Write labels for every question
Include one short label for every form question to make it clear to the user what to do. The
label is the text that appears near a form question.
Write labels without a colon at the end. Otherwise, follow the normal rules for using
punctuation marks (/node/119).
Donʼt put anything in the field the user will type in – this is called ‘placeholder textʼ.
Placeholder text disappears when a person clicks in the field and is usually of very low
contrast.
Write clear labels and ‘help textʼ instead of placeholder text.Avoid this

07/09/2024, 14:00 Forms | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/forms 16/24Make sure labels are close to their question
Align most labels above and close to the questions.
For numerical fields, place the measurement symbol on the usual side it would be written.
For example, put ‘$ʼ on the left side of the field and ‘%ʼ on the right side of the field.
Position checkboxes and radio buttons to the left of the label.
Use <label> or <legend> for digital form headings
If you have one question per page, use that question as the heading for the page.
Put the <label> or <legend> element inside the <h1> element.
This avoids screen readers reading out the same information twice.
Include ‘help textʼ to provide more context
Write extra text to help the user complete the question the first time they try. This is called
‘help textʼ or ‘hint textʼ.
In very complex forms, you might need to link to more detailed explanation.Label for radio buttons (‘Locationʼ)
Example
Create password question
[The question label is also the <H1> heading on this page.]07/09/2024, 14:00 Forms | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/forms 17/24Donʼt use ‘tooltipsʼ to provide help. A tooltip is extra information that appears when the user
hovers over an item. It is difficult to design tooltips that everyone can access. 
Position the help text between the label and the input field. Donʼt use headings, labels or
placeholder text for help text.
Associate the help text with the label for screen reader users.
Use prefilled information and default options if appropriate
for the user
If itʼs appropriate and secure, prefill information. This saves the user time and effort.
Research with users to make sure theyʼre comfortable with prefilling.
Present prefilled information on its own page. Ask the user to check and correct the
information as part of the form page.
Never include pre-selected gender or sex options.Example

Images
Images can help users if they are clear and simple. Make sure everyone can
access the information that images convey.
Add images only if they help the user
Use images if they help users complete their task with your service or product. Images can
make it easier for some people to understand information.
Types of images include:
photographs and decorative images
charts, graphs and maps
diagrams
drawings
icons.
Copyright requirements
You must get permission (a licence) to use copyright material. This includes images
and text.
Some images are available under an open access licence, such as Creative Commons
(https://creativecommons.org.au/). Alt text is also licensed under copyright.07/09/2024, 14:00 Images | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/images 1/8Read the government copyright rules in the Australian Government intellectual
property manual (https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/media-
centre/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).
Choose diverse images that are clear and simple
Choose images that reflect and support the diversity of Australiaʼs peoples and cultures,
especially if you are using images of people. 
Keep images simple and use them to support information in the text.
Images must be:
accessible
easy to understand
relevant
uncluttered
from a credible source
consistent in design and style across the content.
Use the same font and typeface, line thickness and colour scheme in all images of the same
type.
Include decorative images only if they are relevant to the
content
Decorative images, such as photographs, can show an idea and make content more visually
attractive.
Donʼt use images to fill in space. Decorative images must still be relevant. Use images that
relate directly to the content.
People will identify and dismiss stock images that donʼt seem genuine.07/09/2024, 14:00 Images | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/images 2/8Use alt text, captions and titles to
explain images
Follow the guidance on adding alt text, captions and titles (/node/49).
Add alt text to all images. 
Include captions for all images that are not decorative. Add titles to help users scan content.
Accessibility requirements
User needs:
I can understand any information contained in an image.
I can easily control how I see and hear distinctions if colour or sound convey
meaning.
Fundamentals:
Include images on a page only if they meet a real user need. 
Understand the purpose of the image to write alt text (/node/49).
Use real text rather than images of text whenever technically possible. (Logos
can be an exception.)
Make sure that colour is not the only visual means of conveying information in
graphs and diagrams. Text labels and patterns can supplement the use of
colour. Make sure the contrast is sufficient for all users.

color)
Set the correct resolution and file type
Image resolution must be appropriate for the content.
Donʼt embed images with a large file size into content that you will publish online, such as
PDFs or webpages. Optimise and compress all image files so they make it quicker for the
user to access the information.
Design for mobile devices first. An image will scale to the device people view it on. Check
that itʼs easy to read on a mobile phone screen and a desktop.
There are many file types for images. Seek specialist advice to optimise an image file as a
vector or raster file format.
Use graphs, charts and maps if they
explain complex information
Use graphs, charts and maps for information that is too detailed for the text. Donʼt use them
if another format meets the user need – such as a list, table or tool.
Graphs and charts display data, making it easier to understand. They are good for showing:
trends – such as change over time
statistical distributions and patterns
simple comparisons – such as totals for different categories or different rates of change
processes and relationships – such as an organisational structure or a workflow chart.
To make it easier for people to use line graphs and bar charts:
Donʼt add borders or background tints.
Use gridlines only where they help people read the data.07/09/2024, 14:00 Images | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/images 4/8Use ‘tick marksʼ on the x- and y-axes to show the scale of data intervals at a glance.
Avoid more than 10 tick marks on the y-axis.
Scale the y-axis to be consistent across the viewport or page.
Keep it simple (for example, include no more than 3 or 4 data series on a line graph).
Donʼt use colour as the only source of meaning. Try adding dots and dashes to lines
and cross hatching to areas.
Add legends and units of measurement to complex images
All graphs, charts and maps should have a legend that tells people the meaning of lines,
colours and symbols.
Make legends consistent in a webpage or group of webpages dealing with the same
topic. Place the legend in the same position (for example, bottom centre, top left or to the
right).
Use the same font and typeface, and colours and symbols for the same types of information.
Maps must also have a scale bar and an arrow to show which way is north.
Include all units of measurement (/node/147). This helps people understand what the
numbers mean.
Label the x- and y-axes, as well as legends, titles and captions as relevant.
Use appropriate units (for example, millions of dollars for a company balance sheet but
thousands of dollars for a household budget).
Use the appropriate number of decimal places on labels (for example, $1,000 – not
$1,000.00 – for a scale of zero to $10,000).
Refer to informational images in the text
Refer to complex images in the body of the text. It helps people relate the discussion in the
text to the information displayed in the image.
Place the image close to where you mention it in the text. For example, a graph must be on
the same page and after the paragraph that refers to it.
Donʼt repeat the whole caption of the image (/node/49) in the text. Instead, use a locator
number to refer to it, for example ‘Figure 1ʼ.07/09/2024, 14:00 Images | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/images 5/8Donʼt refer to ‘the photograph on the leftʼ. This sensory language is not accessible for some
users.
You donʼt need to refer to decorative images and illustrations in the text unless they are part
of the discussion.
Ensure your text comments on or interprets the image, rather than repeating the text or data
in it.
Check any details that feature in both the text and an image. For example, the text might
quote numbers from a graph. It is easy to make a last-minute change to one and forget to
correct the other.
Print considerations
Avoid referring to a page number in the text because page numbers can change
during the publishing process.Like this
Figure 6 shows an example of good ergonomic posture.
Not this
The photograph of an ideal workstation set-up (see left) shows an example of good
ergonomic posture.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/images 6/8Follow the correct order for image notes
Image notes appear below an image. Notes can apply to the whole image or to one element
of the image.
List notes in the following order:
 . abbreviations
 . notes to superscript locators (such as a superscript ‘#ʼ, ‘aʼ or ‘1ʼ)
 . general note to the image
 . source of data (use the appropriate form for author–date (/node/165) or documentary–
note (/node/166)).
Donʼt include this information in the caption or in ordinary footnotes or endnotes.
Align notes to the left. They should not extend beyond the edges of the image.

Journals, magazines and
newspapers
Journals, magazines and newspapers are known as ‘periodicalsʼ. Periodicals are
published at regular intervals, so they are sometimes called ‘serialsʼ. Number
each issue of a serial and include other publication information so people can
find it.
Include all parts of the periodical
Periodicals get published at regular times. Each issue of a periodical is complete but also
part of a set or volume. Most periodicals are online. Some no longer have a print version. 
Because each issue is complete in itself, you must include the following:
title
year, volume and issue number
name of the sponsoring body
name of the publisher or distributor or both
copyright details
restrictions on circulation
International Standard Serial Number (ISSN).07/09/2024, 14:00 Journals, magazines and newspapers | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/journals-magazines-and-newspapers 1/8Add more details for journals
Journals are periodicals used to present research findings or industry knowledge. The
audience includes specialists or people with an interest in the field. It is common for journals
to peer-review research before publication.
As well as the parts listed for periodicals, it is usual for each article in a journal to have:
the title and author details
an abstract
references as footnotes, endnotes or a list of references
a document object identifier (DOI)
extra material useful for the content.
Consider accessible formats
Online periodicals often have their own websites. The home page should have:
the periodicalʼs branding and contact details
the names of the editors
the aim of the periodical
information for authors on how to submit articles
details on how to subscribe.
Each online issue of a periodical usually has a landing page and a series of articles.
Consider using EPUB, which is an accessible eBook format that users can read on mobile
devices. You can convert Microsoft Word files to EPUB format using the WordToEPUB tool
(https://daisy.org/activities/software/wordtoepub/).
If there is a strong user need to provide a PDF (for example for printing), the document must
still be accessible.
Printed periodicals and periodicals published online as PDF have covers. If the periodical
shows page numbers, use odd numbers for the right-hand pages.07/09/2024, 14:00 Journals, magazines and newspapers | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/journals-magazines-and-newspapers 2/8Accessibility considerations
User needs:  
For a comprehensive list, refer to the overview on accessibility (/node/218).
You must make all government content accessible to people with disability. This is part

Copyright and legal deposit requirements
You must choose a licence to release copyright materials. If you work in government,
use an open access license if you can (for example, Creative Commons
(https://creativecommons.org.au/)).
Read the government copyright rules in the Australian Government intellectual
property manual (https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/media-
centre/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).
The National Library of Australia collects Australian publications under the Copyright
Act 1968 (https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C1968A00063). Your agency is
obliged to contribute publications through legal deposit. Find out more about legal
deposit on the National Library website (https://www.nla.gov.au/legal-deposit). This
information covers online annual reports, which are serials.07/09/2024, 14:00 Journals, magazines and newspapers | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/journals-magazines-and-newspapers 3/8Group issues into volumes
Both digital and print periodicals can group issues into volumes. Thereʼs usually a volume for
each calendar year. Each volume has its own title page, contents list and index.
In print and PDF periodicals, start each new volume at page 1. Number the pages of the
issues so they continue from one issue to the next, throughout the volume.
Separate covers
Some online journals have the cover and publishing information as a separate download. This
is often called ‘front matterʼ. Others keep the entire issue as a stand-alone download.
Print considerations
If the issue has a cover, it will be removed when the issues are put into volumes:
Include the title, date of issue, International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) and
sponsoring body on the outside front cover of the volume.
Repeat all of this information, except for the ISSN, on the first page with the rest
of the essential information, such as copyright and any restrictions on
circulation.
The first page might also contain a contents list, and the final pages might contain an
index.
No separate covers (newspapers and websites)
Newspapers and magazines are examples of periodicals without separate covers. Some
periodicals have a print and digital version. Others are online only.
Digital-only content is archived by date or other metadata such as topic. The print
conventions of binding and page numbers donʼt apply. Archive the articles so people can
find them.
Print considerations
Put the publication details for each issue on the cover page. Include:07/09/2024, 14:00 Journals, magazines and newspapers | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/journals-magazines-and-newspapers 4/8the title
the publishing date
the sponsoring body
the volume and part number (if any).
Put this extra information on page 2 (with the contents list) or the back page:
the name of the printer, publisher, distributor or agent
the editorial address
subscription rates.
Start each issue of a periodical without a separate cover from page 1. Include the title,
date and page number at the top or bottom of the page.
Information management requirements
Articles, journals and other serials that you create for the Australian Government
become records. Records provide evidence of what your organisation has done and
why.
Managing and disposing of records properly is a requirement under the Archives Act
1983 (https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02796). You must follow your
organisationʼs information management requirements. Visit the National Archives of
Australia website for information management standards
(https://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/information-management-
standards).
Apply for identifying numbers for your
periodical
The National Library of Australia has information about how to apply for identifying numbers
for your periodical (https://www.nla.gov.au/content/apply-for-an-isbn-issn-or-ismn).
Identifying numbers are a unique way to locate the work. They include:
International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs)
International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSNs), if the periodical is part of a series.07/09/2024, 14:00 Journals, magazines and newspapers | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/journals-magazines-and-newspapers 5/8ISSNs are a unique way to locate the work. Use separate ISSNs for a digital periodical and a
print periodical, even if they look the same.
For digital-only content, you must publish 5 articles before you can apply for an ISSN.
Your periodical may also be eligible for a cataloguing statement approved by the National
Libraryʼs Prepublication Data Service (https://www.nla.gov.au/content/prepublication-data-
service).
Explain how to access datasets and extra
material
Periodicals can include material that is useful but too detailed to have in the text. To include
it would interrupt the flow of reading.
In digital periodicals, material includes:
audio and video
code
datasets.
Both printed and digital periodicals must tell their users how to access extra material. Online
periodicals use a hyperlink in most cases. Printed periodicals need to tell people how to
access this material if it is not in the appendices.
The United States National Information Standards Organization has recommended practices
for online supplemental journal article material (https://www.niso.org/publications/niso-rp-
15-2013-recommended-practices-online-supplemental-journal-article-materials).

PDF (Portable Document Format)
Only create PDFs if your research shows there are specific needs for this
format. Make PDF content accessible to everyone who needs it.
Create webpages by default
Create content in HTML pages instead of PDFs.
You can configure HTML pages for printing and sharing.
Usability problems with PDFs
PDFs often create problems for users, including:
Scalability – PDFs don't reflow to fit the user's screen or browser windows.
Speed – PDF files are much larger than optimised HTML pages. They can be harder to
use by people with slow internet access.
Navigation – you can't link from a page to a section of a PDF. PDFs can also cause
disorientation when they open in a new tab or different tool.
Search engine optimisation – very often PDFs aren't tagged. This makes it hard for
search engines to find the content.
Maintenance – people download and share PDFs, making it hard for you to ensure that
people are using up-to-date content.
Accessibility considerations
User needs:07/09/2024, 14:00 PDF (Portable Document Format) | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/pdf-portable-document-format 1/5I can access the content in the format I need.
I can change the contentʼs presentation without losing information or structure.
For a comprehensive list, refer to the overview on accessibility (/node/218).
PDFs often create challenges for people using assistive technologies, including text to
voice. These technologies often can't use PDF tagging to describe headings and other
elements. It can also be difficult to navigate complex layouts such as 2 columns.
You must make all government content accessible to people with disability. This is part
of Australian law under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992
(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2018C00125).
The Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) issues advisory notes to help you
comply with the Act. The AHRC advises that if you use PDFs, you should also provide
the content in another format that is accessible (https://humanrights.gov.au/our-
work/disability-rights/world-wide-web-access-disability-discrimination-act-advisory-
notes-ver#pdf).
Do research to find why users need a
PDF
Your research could show that a HTML page doesn't meet certain user needs. People might
need to share documents with specific functionality or layout such as a pamphlet or form.
Before using a PDF, check if other document formats will meet the need. An example is the
electronic publishing (EPUB) file format. EPUB documents scale to the screen sizes of
different mobile devices.
Don't use a Microsoft Word document if you need to protect the document from changes
after it's shared.
Make PDF content accessible to all users
When you publish a PDF:

There may be barriers to creating accessible formats from certain existing PDFs.
Government is not allowed to change some documents authored by independent
organisations. This includes audits and privacy impact assessments.
When there are significant barriers to providing content in another format, at least:
create a landing page with a high-level summary of the content
provide a way for people to request an accessible version – for example, an email
address.

Reports
Create complete reports with a landing page, preliminary content, body and
endmatter. Include other parts if the report needs to be tabled in parliament.
Order the parts of the report
There are conventions that apply to how the information in reports should appear.
The basic parts of a report are:
a landing page (a cover for printed reports)
preliminary content (separate pages in printed reports)
the main part of the report
supporting information (endmatter).
The type of report will determine what to include and where.
Consider publishing format
Most government reports are published online, either as HTML or downloadable files.
Consider user needs and compliance requirements when deciding on format.
HTML should be the default format for all government information. Some other formats have
extra functionality, for example:
a ‘search full reportʼ option07/09/2024, 14:00 Reports | Style Manual

EPUB is an accessible e-book format that users can read on mobile devices. You can convert
Microsoft Word files to EPUB format using the WordToEPUB tool
(https://daisy.org/activities/software/wordtoepub/).
There may be a user need or compliance requirement to publish a PDF or printed report. You
should also make sure the content is available in another format, such as HTML.

Check the rules for tabling reports
There are rules for presenting documents in the Australian Parliament. Presenting
documents is called ‘tablingʼ.07/09/2024, 14:00 Reports | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/reports 2/14The rules are set out in the Tabling guidelines (https://www.pmc.gov.au/resource-
centre/government/tabling-guidelines). The guidelines apply to most documents, including:
annual reports
reports of royal commissions
periodic reports required by law
reports tabled at the initiative of the government
treaties.
There are a few exceptions, explained in the guidelines, that are not covered by these rules.
The exceptions include reports of parliamentary committees.
Print considerations
The Parliament of Australia details printing standards for documents to be included in
the Parliamentary Papers Series
(https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Chamber_documents/Tabled_Papers
/Advice_to_government_agencies#standards).
You must produce documents in line with parliamentary printing standards. Electronic
versions must be identical to printed versions and must be accessible.
Annual reports
Australian Government annual reports must be tabled in the Australian Parliament.
The Department of Finance has guidelines on what to include in the annual reports of
Australian Government departments and agencies.
Follow its guidance about requirements to make sure your annual report complies
(https://www.finance.gov.au/government/managing-commonwealth-resources/planning-
reporting/annual-reports).
Australian Government departments and agencies must also publish their annual reports
through the Transparency Portal (https://www.transparency.gov.au/). Contact the
Department of Finance to get access to the tool.
Information management requirements07/09/2024, 14:00 Reports | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/reports 3/14You must use the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) when preparing
government information. The PSPF covers how information is classified and marked,
and what this means for its storage, handling, access and disposal. Consult the PSPF
webpages (https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/information/sensitive-classified-
information/Pages/default.aspx) or consult your organisationʼs protective security
policy.
Information (including reports) that you create for the Australian Government become
records. Records provide evidence of what your organisation has done and why.
Managing and disposing of records properly is a requirement under the Archives Act
1983 (https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02796). You must follow your
organisationʼs information management requirements. Visit the National Archives of
Australia website for information management standards
(https://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/information-management-
standards).
Use the landing page or cover to identify
the report
All reports have a landing page or cover (if printed). Use these to give an overview of the
report so people can decide if they want to download or read it.
The landing page or cover also shows the:
title
subtitle, if any
name of the author or editor.
They may also show other details such as the date and the publisher.
Print considerations
In print publications:
the inside front and back covers are often blank – they can include information
from the reverse title page
the back cover may be blank or show details that arenʼt on the reverse title page.07/09/2024, 14:00 Reports | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/reports 4/14Dust jackets protect a printed work and advertise it.
The front shows the title and author.
The back shows reviews, retail price if relevant, and ISBN or ISSN.
The flaps often contain blurbs about the publication and author.
If more than about 5 millimetres wide, the spine shows the title, author and
publisherʼs logo. The words always run across or down the spine.
Include a title page and preliminary parts
There are many items you can include in preliminary content. Some are best suited to printed
publications. Judge what you need for your report.
Australian Government reports published online should include the same information as a
printed version.
A title page should include the following:
title
subtitle, if any
authorʼs name
name of the sponsor, if applicable.
It can also have additional details such as the name of a compiler, translator, reviser or
illustrator.
The reverse title page, or ‘imprintʼ page, includes details that donʼt appear on the title page,
such as:
copyright notices, including copyright held by others such as photographers and
illustrators
the publisherʼs imprint or name and address
lists of editions and reprints
list of other volumes in a multi-volume set (this can also be on a separate page)
identifying numbers and library classification data
name of others contributing to the document, such as the editor, designer or illustrator.07/09/2024, 14:00 Reports | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/reports 5/14Many online reports put imprint page material on the splash screen or landing page.
Wherever it features, people should be able to easily find copyright and other information
about the report.
Print considerations
You can put information prepared for the reverse title page somewhere else such as
the inside front cover or back cover, if youʼre not leaving those blank.
Printed reports can also have half-title and reverse half-title pages.
The purpose of the half-title page is to protect the title page in a printed publication. It
is not relevant for online publishing.
Conventions for a half-title page are:
Show the main title exactly as it appears on the cover.
Do not show any subtitles.
Include a series title if the report is part of a series.
The reverse half-title page is often blank. It can include:
a list of other works by the same author
a list of other contributors
details of the series it is part of
details of other volumes in the set
part of an illustration that spills over from the title page.
Check the order of the preliminary pages. Number them with lower case roman
numerals such as ʼiʼ, ʼiiʼ, ʼiiiʼ and ʼivʼ.
Identifying numbers and library classification data
The National Library of Australia provides information about how to apply for identifying
numbers for your report (https://www.nla.gov.au/content/apply-for-an-isbn-issn-or-ismn).
Identifying numbers are a unique way to locate the work. They include:
International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs)
International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSNs), if the report is part of a series.07/09/2024, 14:00 Reports | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/reports 6/14Your report may also be eligible for a cataloguing statement approved by the National
Libraryʼs Prepublication Data Service (https://www.nla.gov.au/content/prepublication-data-
service).
Copyright and legal deposit requirements
You must choose a licence to release copyright materials. If you work in government,
use an open access licence if you can (for example, Creative Commons
(https://creativecommons.org.au/)).
Read the government copyright rules in the Australian Government intellectual
property manual (https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/media-
centre/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).
The National Library of Australia collects Australian publications under the Copyright
Act 1968 (https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C1968A00063 ). Your agency is
obliged to contribute published reports through legal deposit. Find out more about
legal deposit on the National Library website (https://www.nla.gov.au/legal-deposit).
This information covers online annual reports.
Letter of transmittal
A letter of transmittal is a message or letter to the person requesting the report. It is often
included in annual reports and other reports prepared by committees, commissions and
consultants. Sometimes it must be part of a report.
The letter of transmittal must include the purpose of the report and who it is for. It must
have:
the signature of the person responsible for the report
the day, month and year the report was submitted.
Forewords, prefaces and introductions
A report often has a foreword, preface or introduction. They have different functions and you
would rarely need them all.
A foreword:
is always in the preliminary content
is usually written by someone other than the author and often includes their signature07/09/2024, 14:00 Reports | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/reports 7/14explains the purpose of the report and why itʼs important
helps a wider audience to relate to the report.
A preface:
is always in the preliminary content
can replace a short introduction
is written by the author and can include the author's signature
tells the user why and how the report was prepared
can include a short list of acknowledgements
describes changes if it's a new version or update.
An introduction:
can be in the preliminary content or main part of the report
should be in the main part of the report if people will need the content to understand
the report – for example, if the introduction includes terms of reference
is by the author or someone else
does not include a signature
can replace a preface to discuss why and how the report was prepared
includes long lists of acknowledgements
describes changes if itʼs a new version or update.
Contents
A list of contents helps the user to get an overview of the report. In HTML, this can often
inform the menu navigation.
Use the heading ‘Contentsʼ, not ‘Table of contentsʼ or ‘List of contentsʼ.
There is rarely a need to use more than 3 levels of headings. Use design elements such as
colour or typeface size for complex contents. This can separate the levels of heading and
show the structure of the report. Make sure design elements are accessible.
Lists of images and tables
Include a list of images and tables if it is helpful to the user.07/09/2024, 14:00 Reports | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/reports 8/14Images can include photographs, figures and maps. Most reports only need a list of images
and tables.
Give each image a page number in the list. In print, include even full-page images that donʼt
have a visible page number.
The order of lists is:
 . photographs (only in print)
 . figures
 . maps (if listed separately)
 . tables.
Acknowledgements
There are many ways to acknowledge contributors to a report, such as in:
the preface, if there are few acknowledgements
the introduction, for long acknowledgements
a separate section, if many people helped or there are a many non-bibliographic
sources to note
an appendix, if there are lengthy acknowledgements.
Summary
For long reports, use a summary to present findings, recommendations and conclusions.
Name the summary to show its purpose. For example, you can use ‘Recommendationsʼ
or ‘Summaryʼ.
Don't use ‘Executive summaryʼ. Although this is common, it is not best practice.
Organise the main body into chapters or
parts
To organise the text in the main body of the report use:
chapters
parts for long reports, with chapters in each part.07/09/2024, 14:00 Reports | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/reports 9/14Both chapters and parts need short titles that tell the user what is in the content.
Use consecutive numbering for chapter titles through the report. If the report contains parts,
continue the chapter numbering into each part. For example, ‘Part 2ʼ might start with
‘Chapter 5ʼ.
There are many ways to number parts:
Part 1, Part 2
Part A, Part B
Part One, Part Two.
Print considerations
Don't use roman numerals to number parts. Users can confuse the roman II with the
arabic number 11. It is better to start chapters and parts on a right-hand page,
particularly the first chapter and part. Also follow this approach for PDF reports.
Include the material that supports the
report (endmatter)
In reports, endmatter can include:
appendices
a list of shortened forms
a glossary
reference lists, endnotes and bibliographies
an index.
Print considerations
Page numbering for the endmatter continues from the main body of the report.07/09/2024, 14:00 Reports | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/reports 10/14Appendices
Use an appendix for relevant material that is too detailed to put in the main part of the report.
This can include:
maps
technical information
material from an external source that keeps an organisation's branding.
Number appendices differently from how chapters are numbered in the report. For example,
if chapters have arabic numerals (‘Chapter 1ʼ, ‘Chapter 2ʼ) number appendices alphabetically
(‘Appendix Aʼ, ‘Appendix Bʼ).
Print considerations
If there are several appendices, use a title page. List the title of each appendix on the
title page. The title page is usually a right-hand page.
List of shortened forms
Include an alphabetical list of shortened forms or abbreviations when these are useful for the
user.
If the list is brief, include it in the preliminary content. Do not incorporate the list of shortened
forms in the glossary.
Glossary
Use a glossary to explain specialist or unfamiliar terms. Donʼt use a glossary if there is a
small number of terms to explain. You can explain these in the main part of the report.
List glossary items in alphabetical order.
Format the glossary to make it easy for the user to find the term.
Reference lists, endnotes and bibliographies
Always place a bibliography after a reference list or endnotes if the report has both.07/09/2024, 14:00 Reports | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/reports 11/14Index
An index can be useful for long or detailed reports, especially in print.
Case studies, data lists and non-essential material
Reports can have separate information related to the main text. Examples include case
studies and lists of data.
Online reports often link to this material. Other ways of separating this from the main body of
the report are:
using coloured backgrounds
putting lengthy material at the end of the report, before other endmatter.
Split large reports into volumes
Digital and printed reports can work better in volumes if they are large. Create a volume at a
suitable point in the text.
Each volume should have a summary list of the contents of the other volumes in the set. The
index can be in each volume or in the final volume only.
Number the pages according to the break in the volumes:
When the break is in the main body of the text, continue the numbering across
volumes.
When the break is for different material (for example, endmatter), number each volume
in a separate way.
Print considerations
Always number preliminary pages per volume.
Where numbering restarts for each volume, references should include both the
volume and page number. Where the numbering continues across volumes, use just
the page number for the reference.07/09/2024, 14:00 Reports | Style Manual

Social media
Social media can enhance your engagement with users and stakeholders.
Identify the audience, purpose and platforms and design content for them.
Use social media to listen and engage
Social media allows government to increase understanding of users and keep them
informed.
Use a social media monitoring tool to track conversations online. Find out what people are
saying about your topic. Understand their problems and concerns.
You can use social media to:
help people find information about government services and policy
encourage people to engage with your agency by commenting and sharing
share updates on important work
promote other content, such as blog posts
promote and encourage participation in events
build a network of people who are interested in your agencyʼs work.
Anything published on social media should follow your organisationʼs social media
strategy. Never rely on social media alone to engage with the community.

Define the audience before you write
Find out who will engage with your post and why before you start writing. Each social media
platform has a different audience. 
Each platform has its own analytics tool to help you learn about them. 
Ensure there's capacity to engage with comments and enquiries on your post.
Design for each relevant platform
Prepare content specifically for each platform. Check that a social media platform is the best
option before you publish.07/09/2024, 14:01 Social media | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/social-media 2/11Will it help the people who use your services and products?
Will it help them understand the people and processes of government?
Not every platform is appropriate for every message.
Content needs to be accessible no matter which platform you use, including video and audio
content (/node/42).
The following platforms are currently popular in government and the Australian community.
LinkedIn
Business, government and industry use LinkedIn for professional networking. LinkedIn is
suitable for publishing:
job openings and career opportunities
professional insights
case studies
information about training and other opportunities
industry news.
X (formerly Twitter)
News media, industry and government use X (formerly Twitter) for networking, news and
public commentary. 
X is a platform for current content. Use X to tap into current events, news and positive
stories. 
The maximum length of tweets is 280 characters. Write one idea in a short, attention-
grabbing sentence. Most tweets have a key idea and a link to a webpage. Donʼt use internet
slang in government tweets.
Use keywords in hashtags, which have a # symbol. Hashtags help people find and follow
topics of interest. If you are publishing a new topic, try to use an existing or trending hashtag
rather than creating a new one.
You need no more than 2 hashtags. Too many hashtags makes your content difficult to read
and less accessible.07/09/2024, 14:01 Social media | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/social-media 3/11Use ‘camel caseʼ for compound hashtags. The first letter of each word in the hashtag starts
with a capital letter – for example, #SelfQuarantine.
Address other users with the @ sign before their username. Remember, these tweets are
public and visible.
Facebook
People use Facebook for personal social networking, business promotion, entertainment and
news. Do not publish technical content on Facebook.
Facebook is suitable for publishing:
human interest stories
profiles of staff
information for communities of practice
events
career opportunities.
Videos on Facebook should be interesting and as short as possible. They should have only
one message that is clear in the first second.
Facebook content has less than 2 seconds to grab attention before people scroll past it, if
they see it at all. Content needs to be compelling so it reaches the people you want to reach.
YouTube
YouTube videos cover entertainment, instructional and lifestyle topics, among many others.
Most videos on YouTube are between 3 and 12 minutes in length and can:
show people how to do something
explain a complex topic
share human interest stories
celebrate case studies
include people in events.
YouTube videos should:

Instagram
People use Instagram for entertainment, news, lifestyle, social networking and business. It is
popular in the technical and design communities.
Share photographs and short videos on Instagram. Showcase interesting people, places and
technology.
Instagram content should either:
be visually creative
create a sense of intimacy with the people behind the account.
Links donʼt work well on Instagram. Include all your information in the post rather than linking
to websites.
Use plain language and the right tone
Use plain language and a conversational, positive tone on social media. Avoid jargon
and acronyms.
Aim to be topical and timely with your posts, rather than workshopping them to perfection –
but avoid obvious mistakes.
You can use an exclamation mark or a question mark after:
a web address (URL)
a tag
a hashtag
an emoji.
Donʼt add a full stop after hashtags, emojis or handles.
Follow your organisationʼs guidelines about appropriate use of emojis. Use them sparingly.07/09/2024, 14:01 Social media | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/social-media 5/11Accessibility and inclusivity requirements
Use emojis, not emoticons. Emojis are standardised pictographs
(https://home.unicode.org/emoji/about-emoji/). Emoticons display as punctuation
marks in text and are not standardised.
Choose common emojis and make sure the user can understand the message if the
emoji is removed.
Content needs respect all people, their rights and their heritage. Use inclusive imagery
and inclusive language (/node/178).
Include images and video that enhance
the message
Social media is a visual-first, mobile-first medium. Plan content with this in mind.
Use video and images as the basis of your content wherever possible. Visual content needs
to be timely, relevant and engaging. Set the video aspect and resolution for the userʼs device
(/node/41#set_the_video_aspect_and_resolution_for_the_users_device).
Use alt text and closed captions, or provide a link to content with these elements. Also
ensure you include any text in the image that is in the text of the post itself.
Follow your organisationʼs branding guidelines
(/node/41#apply_government_branding_to_all_audio_and_video). Official photography
should carry your organisationʼs mark or logo in the bottom right-hand corner.
You might need to use release forms before you use anyoneʼs image in any social media
platform. Before you post, check if you have the right permissions
(/node/41#get_permissions_and_licences_for_copyright_material).
Accessibility requirements
User needs:
I can understand any information contained in an image.
I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.07/09/2024, 14:01 Social media | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/social-media 6/11Fundamentals:
Include images, video and audio on a page only if they meet a real user need.
Make sure the contrast is sufficient for all users.
Prepare alt text for images (/node/49). 
Follow the requirements for video and audio (/node/41).

video and images.
Some material is available under an open access licence, such as Creative Commons
(https://creativecommons.org.au/).
You must attribute copyright material (/node/174).

property manual (https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/media-

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/social-media 7/11Post content at the times that suit the
audience
Timing is a critical component of successful content. Post when something is still fresh and
people are still interested. It is this immediacy that gives you authority when you publish
something to social media.
Publish on a schedule that is appropriate for the platform, but only if you have something to
say and can say it well. People may start to ignore your posts if:
you publish too often
your content is not well written or newsworthy.
Manage risk with a social media policy
Social media encourages people to engage in a discussion with your organisation. Have a
social media policy with a clear framework for what is and what is not acceptable behaviour. 
Prepare a social media risk assessment to identify:
potential risks to your organisationʼs reputation
the steps you will take to mitigate that risk.
Many organisations have talking points or standard responses for replying to comments.
Social media content is designed to be shared. Ask for your organisationʼs social media
strategy before you share other peopleʼs posts. Sharing may imply endorsement.
Content that you post can also be shared out of context, and it is almost impossible to
remove content once it is in the public domain.
Think carefully about how someone might interpret posts without any context. Be specific so
the context is clear from the post itself. This helps people understand the message you
intend.
Be aware of privacy concerns and offensive material on social media.07/09/2024, 14:01 Social media | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/social-media 8/11Privacy requirements
Your organisation has obligations under the Privacy Act 1988
(https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/).
Privacy is relevant whenever itʼs possible to identify someone. Treat things that can or
might identify an individual as personal information. A social media post might feature
someoneʼs picture as an image or in a video, for example.
When you handle personal information, you must comply with the Australian Privacy
Principles (https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/). Personal
information is any information that could identify an individual and apply to any format.
The Privacy Act and Privacy Principles also apply to any personal information you
collect from a social media platform. People have the right to request access to their
personal information under the Privacy Principles and the Freedom of Information Act
1982 (https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02562).
The federal regulator for privacy and freedom of information legislation is the Office of
the Australian Information Commissioner (https://www.oaic.gov.au/).

Home (/)>Content types (/content-types)>Video and audio
Video and audio
Video and audio are time-based media. Users can choose when and how much
they view or listen to. If the format meets a user need, make sure anyone can
access the content.
Use video or audio when users find it
easy to understand and access
Ask whether time-based media (video or audio) is the best way to deliver a message or tell a
story.
Check you:
understand who will use it, how they will access it and why
have (or can you get) the resources and expertise to do it.
Use video or audio if it:
suits the type of information you want to include
helps you reach most people who need to find that information
is accessible to those people.
Some users might find another content format more useful. If you create video or audio
content, be aware of:
accessibility for time-based media (for example, closed captions)
the potential effect of flickering and dynamic content on a screen07/09/2024, 14:01 Video and audio | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/video-and-audio 1/12language difficulties
the userʼs environment (for example, a workplace where sound disturbs colleagues)
timing in the content and the time users are likely to spend using the content.
Provide a text alternative to video and audio for:
users who cannot reliably read captions or hear audio
users who have time pressures
search engine optimisation (SEO).
Before deciding if video or audio is the right format, do user research (/node/76).
Time-based media need more resources than text to produce, maintain and update. Text-
based content is usually a more feasible and accessible option to meet a user need.
Accessibility requirements
User needs:
I can access equivalent information to anything contained in a video or audio file.
I can easily control how I see and hear distinctions if colour or sound convey
meaning.
Fundamentals:
Create accessible video and audio with the correct alternative versions so
everyone can access the information.
Meet AAA success criteria for video when content is of national importance. For
example, for voting or Census participation and access to National Health and
Safety information.
Follow the detailed requirements for video and audio (/node/41).

Create video if the user needs a quick
explanation
Video works best when it is short, accessible and shows something people need to know
quickly.
Governments use video to communicate with their employees and the public. Some uses are
to:
introduce new topics and ideas
promote government programs
explain policies and procedures to staff
show people how to do something, such as complete a form
stream events and ceremonies.
All video production requires a level of in-house and external professional expertise. Follow
the requirements and standards for video and audio (/node/41).07/09/2024, 14:01 Video and audio | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/video-and-audio 3/12Duration
Online videos should have one key message. They should be be no more than one to 2
minutes long, especially if you share the video on social media.
Videos covering complex topics and hosted on your organisationʼs website can be longer.
Check your organisationʼs policy for the preferred length of videos.
Break the video into smaller, stand-alone pieces if:
the message is complex
there is more than one message.
Platform
You can place video on webpages, blogs or social media channels. Once you have chosen a
platform, check its video publishing guidelines. Video is the preferred format of some social
media platforms (/node/43#design_for_each_relevant_platform). Check which file format
the platform accepts.
Tags
You can add tags or hashtags on any platform to help people find video content. Add
hashtags across several platforms to increase the likelihood that people will find the video. 
Use words that the user is most likely to type into search engines.
Animation
Use animation to show complex processes or abstract ideas.
Animation works well on social media platforms. People can usually understand them with or
without audio.
As for other types of videos, animation must tell a story. You should include a call to action
so users know what they can do next.
Animation videos are not only cartoons or slideshows. Use animated infographics to show
and explain government information and services. Examples include:
evolving timelines and charts07/09/2024, 14:01 Video and audio | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/video-and-audio 4/12moving text on maps and graphs
interactive graphics that allow an expanded view or that change when selected.
Use professionals to create animation videos. Animators:
structure and evolve messages in creative ways
understand how viewers respond to different elements of animation design
pace the changes onscreen so viewers have the time to understand what is happening.
Accessibility requirements
User needs:
I can understand any information contained in an image.
I can easily control how I see and hear distinctions if colour or sound convey
meaning.
Fundamentals:
When using text or images of text in animation, meet minimum requirements
for colour contrast.
Ensure colour is not the only means of conveying meaning.
Follow the requirements and standards for video and audio (/node/41).
WCAG quick reference:
1.4.1 Use of colour – level A (https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?
showtechniques=128#use-of-color)
1.4.3 Contrast (minimum) – level AA (https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?
showtechniques=128#contrast-minimum)
Live action video
Use live action to show people in a real-world environment.
Live action requires careful composition. Ensure that the subject is:
clearly lit
in focus07/09/2024, 14:01 Video and audio | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/video-and-audio 5/12not obstructed by other features.
Use candid shots and real scenes that are simple, interesting and original. Visuals should be
crisp and use natural colours.
People in the video should wear appropriate clothing and avoid:
offensive slogans or slogans that will distract the viewer
branding and logos
fine patterns and stripes, which reduce image quality by creating a ‘moiréʼ pattern.
Moiré patterns give a distorted representation of fine detail in an image.
Broadcasting live
Use live broadcast to record events as they happen.
Live broadcast works well for discussions, addresses and interviews. Often, they are
broadcast in-house to staff in government agencies.
A live broadcast needs equipment, scripting, lighting, staging and audio expertise. 
Accessibility requirements
User needs:
I can access equivalent information to anything contained in a video or audio file.
Fundamentals:
Include live captioning in synchronised media for live broadcasts to ensure
content is available to all users. 
Follow the requirements and standards for video and audio (/node/41).

showtechniques=128#captions-live)07/09/2024, 14:01 Video and audio | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/video-and-audio 6/12Add audio if the user needs more help
to understand
Audio supports video (audio-visual content), or can be its own type of content (audio-only
content). Many agencies also produce audio descriptions of written material to make content
accessible.
Examples of audio-visual content include:
soundtracks for online training material
audio for videos, filmed presentations and live events
short sound files for government and agency branding.
Examples of government audio-only content are:
oral histories
historical recordings used for educational purposes
podcasts.
Audio-only content can be an engaging and relatable way to explain complex topics. You
can:
record events, such as speeches
create longer-form audio, such as podcasts
use historical audio of people and events to bring the past alive for listeners.
Audio-only content can improve someoneʼs understanding of a topic. It takes a lot of
resources to create, enhance and publish audio on its own. Other formats may meet user
needs more effectively. Do user research to find out who will listen to the audio and why.
Follow the requirements and standards for audio (/node/41).
Finalise the script before you start
recording
Have a clear story before you begin production.07/09/2024, 14:01 Video and audio | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/video-and-audio 7/12Effective audio-visual or audio-only content begins with a script that:
outlines what the content will cover (the beginning)
uses action and audio to show the key idea (the middle)
tells people about what they can do next (the end). 
Take the time to create a well-written script with a clear structure. 
Ensure audio and supporting text use inclusive language (/node/178). Show inclusion and
diversity in imagery (for audio-visual content) and script roles.
Agree on the script with stakeholders and approvers before you record. Itʼs much easier to
change a script or outline than the content once you produce it.
Use the script as the basis for the text version (media alternative) for the recording to meet
accessibility and SEO requirements.
Structure and format
Script-writing requires technical skill. A good script is written by someone who either:
understands the topic and can write a script to support it
can do the necessary research and work with a subject expert.
Otherwise, thereʼs a risk the script will not be accurate. This means users may get the wrong
message or mistrust what they hear and stop listening. Consider using a professional script
writer.
Scripts provide clear directions for speakers about emphasis and pronunciation. When
printed or displayed, scripts use:
a plain font
wide line spacing
white space
short paragraphs
short sentences and some longer sentences to reflect speech patterns
markers for brief pauses throughout to help speakers breathe and listeners think
The length of the script depends on the topic and the format youʼre recording.07/09/2024, 14:01 Video and audio | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/video-and-audio 8/12Some video and audio formats are partially scripted. The partial script will outline both the
beginning and the end of the content, but might not structure the middle.
For an interview, you might create a conversation outline with a series of questions.
Responses and follow-up questions might be unscripted. You should still write the beginning
and end of the content as script.
Language and tone in audio-only content
Because audio-only content isnʼt supported by images, language and tone of voice are
important:
Use simple language and a conversational tone, and avoid jargon.
Donʼt over-simplify to the point where you lose meaning and people feel patronised.
A conversational tone also helps the speakers inject their personalities into the script.
Follow Australian Public Service values, regardless of the topic.
Proofing
Read the script aloud. This is the best way to find out what works and what doesnʼt work.
You can record yourself and listen back to build empathy with users.
Check that the script explains what users want or need to understand. If it doesnʼt, rewrite it.
Use a timer to help you work out how long the script might take to record.
Choose actors and speakers to suit the
content (the talent)
‘Talentʼ is the industry term for the people who feature in video and audio content.
The talent you engage, and when you engage them, depends on the type of content. For
example, you might:
plan an oral history project around a particular speaker
engage an expert speaker who understands technical subjects.
It can also make sense to find suitable speakers after you write the script. Some audio needs
professional interview skills or voice talent.07/09/2024, 14:01 Video and audio | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/video-and-audio 9/12Make sure:
the people being recorded speak clearly
speech is at a rate of between 130 and 170 words per minute. This is about the rate of
an Australian giving a speech that is easy to understand
you record at a volume, pace, tone and rhythm that are appropriate to the message.
You might also:
factor the cost of a speaker into your planning (and budget) 
consider your approach to recruiting diverse talent, as more people relate to audio-
visual content that is inclusive and representative.
Ensure everyone featuring in video or audio content signs a release form.
Privacy requirements
Your organisation has obligations under the Privacy Act 1988
(https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/).
Privacy is relevant whenever it's possible to identify someone. Treat things that can or
might identify an individual as personal information. Personal information can include
things like a voice recording or someone's appearance.
When you handle personal information, you must comply with the Australian Privacy
Principles (https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/). Personal
information is any information that could identify an individual, in any format.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/video-and-audio 10/12The Content Guide had guidelines on video use, content and length. It has information about
accessibility requirements for video, including the use of audio description.

Alt text, captions and titles for images
Alt text, captions and titles for
images
Alternative text explains information in images for screen reader users.
Captions describe images to help users relate them to surrounding text. Titles
identify images and number them in long-form content.
Give all users access to the same
information
When people use content with images, they get information from different elements.
Users combine information from:
image captions and titles
body text and the images themselves
alt text.
These elements have different purposes.
Titles help identify specific images (for example, ‘Figure 1ʼ) – particularly if they are
listed or referenced in other parts of the content. They are different from the HTML title
attribute (https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_title.asp).
Captions are brief descriptions related to the image (for example commentary,
attributions or quotations).07/09/2024, 14:01 Alt text, captions and titles for images | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/images/alt-text-captions-and-titles-images 1/13Alternative text (alt text) is a short description of the information an image conveys. Itʼs
either available to the user as an HTML attribute or through a documentʼs accessibility
tool. Alt text is not usually visible on the page.
An extended description is alternative text that explains a complex image. It is visible either
on the same page or on a separate page. You might write an extended description for a chart
or process, for example.
Donʼt:
hide information in the alt text, as a user might not see it
repeat information in the alt text that a user would read in the caption
use the <longdesc> attribute for extended descriptions.
Add alt text to all images
Include short alt text – less than about 100 characters – for all informative images.
Decorative images should have null alt text (alt="").
Users need images to have alt text for different purposes.
Screen readers read out alt text to tell a user whatʼs in it and why itʼs there.
Browsers and mobile devices display alt text to tell a user with a slow internet
connection or limited data about an image that isnʼt displayed.
Search engines use alt text to index images to make it easier for a user to find
information.
Accessibility requirements
User need:
I can understand any information contained in an image.Example
Users are at the centre of the content lifecycle. The cycle starts with intent. It then
moves through 6 stages: discover needs; draft; test; approve; publish; maintain. The
process is circular. The cycle shows continuous improvement through repetition. Stages
can repeat before completing a full cycle.07/09/2024, 14:01 Alt text, captions and titles for images | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/images/alt-text-captions-and-titles-images 2/13Fundamentals:
Add alternative text for all images. For help with writing good alt text: the W3C
alt decision tree (https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/).
Write alternative text that describes the information or function of the image. For
help to describe images: the W3C/WAI Web Accessibility Tutorials - Images
(https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/).
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criterion:
1.1.1 Non-text content – level A (https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#non-text-
content).
Include captions for all images that are
not decorative
Add captions for all images, unless they are only decorative.
Use captions to acknowledge the creator or copyright holder of images in captions. Use your
organisationʼs referencing style (/node/181).
Include the HTML <figcaption> element to associate the caption with the image.
For more instructions about using figure captions, visit Web Accessibility Tutorials – complex
images (https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/complex/).
Copyright requirements
When referencing, you must attribute copyright material (/node/181). This includes
images and text.Example
<figure>
<figcaption>Figure 3: Kangaroo numbers in Victoria from 1880 to 1980</figcaption>
<img src="kangaroo.svg" alt= "Line graph showing a doubling of kangaroo numbers
from 1880 to 1980">
... </figure>07/09/2024, 14:01 Alt text, captions and titles for images | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/images/alt-text-captions-and-titles-images 3/13Write the attribution as part of the caption or following the copyright material. Alt text
is also licensed under copyright.
Read the government copyright rules in the Australian Government intellectual
property manual (https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/media-
centre/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).
Write alt text and captions to support
the imageʼs purpose
The detail you need to include in alt text, captions and titles depends on the reason you have
included the image.
Decorative images add visual interest but not information (for example, the background
pattern on a website).
Informative images convey simple concepts or information (for example, how to open a
medication bottle).
Functional images are part of interactions and donʼt convey information (for example,
Australian Government branding that links to a home page).
Decorative images
Include an empty value, or null text, for alt text if the image is decorative. This is 2 double
quotation marks with no space (alt=""). In documents, set images as ‘Decorative imageʼ or
‘Background imageʼ. The empty value tells screen readers to ignore the image.
An image is decorative if you can remove it from the page without losing any meaning or
information.
Include keywords in the surrounding text to support search engines. Donʼt create alt text to
add keywords.
Informational images
Write alt text that conveys the same important information as the image.
Donʼt write something in the alt text that a user canʼt learn from seeing the image or reading
the caption or title.07/09/2024, 14:01 Alt text, captions and titles for images | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/images/alt-text-captions-and-titles-images 4/13Add captions and titles that give context.
Donʼt repeat the information provided by the image and alt text. This prevents users of
screen readers from hearing the same information twice.
If the caption or nearby text already explains the informational image, you might use very
brief alt text.
Examples of informative images that might have an empty value in the alt text include:
a photograph with a caption that is a full description of the content and function of the
photograph
a snapshot of a software screen that the text describes
an illustration of an idea that the text describes.
In these cases, the images give visual learners another way to access information in the text.
You could remove the image without losing the meaning, but this might disadvantage users
who need a visual explanation.
Logos
Write the full name of the organisation in the logo alt text.
For logos that are functional links to home pages, use the name of the site in the link instead
of the alt text. You donʼt need to add the name to the link if it is already in the text on the
page.Example
You might use alt="Screenshot of dropdown menu and buttons"  if the
nearby
    text (for example, the caption) had this instruction:
Select the ‘save’ button between the ‘Tools’ drop-down and the
‘Cancel’ button07/09/2024, 14:01 Alt text, captions and titles for images | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/images/alt-text-captions-and-titles-images 5/13Icons
Write different alt text for decorative, informative or functional icons.
Use empty alt text (alt="") to declare it as decorative.
Describe the informational icon so the user can understand what it is.
State the functional iconʼs purpose so the user can understand the outcome.
Complex images
Complex images contain too much information to include in the alt text alone.
To make sure people can access the information include:
alt text that contains a brief interpretation of the main idea from the image
a caption that summarises the image
an extended description with more details about the data in the image, usually
referencing the title or caption of the image.
Link in-text references to the image title only if it helps the user.
Write the extended description on the same page or, if it is very long, link to it on a separate
page. Do not use the <longdesc> attribute.Example
A decorative printer icon: alt=""
An informational printer icon: alt="Printer icon"
A functional printer icon: alt="Print this page"07/09/2024, 14:01 Alt text, captions and titles for images | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/images/alt-text-captions-and-titles-images 6/13Use the extended description to help the user understand the information in the image. Put
most of the interpretation of the image in the body text. If the image is a graph, you might
link to a table of data.
Extended descriptions usually include:
what is being measured (the axis labels) and the units of measurements
the range of data – the maximum and minimum or first and last
the average or other statistics
a description of the trend in the data – increasing or decreasing
comparisons between data sets, such as ‘more thanʼ, ‘relativeʼ or ‘inverseʼ.
For examples of alt text, visit Benetech Initiativeʼs General image description guidelines
(http://diagramcenter.org/table-of-contents-2.html#contents). They also have examples of
maps, diagrams, complex images and extended descriptions for graphs
(http://diagramcenter.org/specific-guidelines-e.html).
Photographs and illustrations
Include alt text and captions for all informative photographs and illustrations. The information
you provide depends on the content format.
Example07/09/2024, 14:01 Alt text, captions and titles for images | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/images/alt-text-captions-and-titles-images 7/13This image could have a different caption and alt text, depending on the content format.
An environmental committee report might include a list of species with a photo and links
to management plans. This is a functional image that serves as a link.
Caption for committee report: Hoary sunray (Leucochysum albicans) (caption
is hyperlinked)
Alt text for committee report: alt=""
An agency visitor centre might publish a guide to the Snowy Mountains.
Caption for visitor guide: These beautiful flowers (Hoary sunray) decorate the
Snowy Mountains in summer
Alt text for visitor guide: alt="Photograph of flower growing in rocky ground"07/09/2024, 14:01 Alt text, captions and titles for images | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/images/alt-text-captions-and-titles-images 8/13Use consistent formatting and
punctuation for captions and titles
Align captions and titles to the left. Place captions for decorative images, such as
photographs, below the image.
Titles and captions donʼt need to be a complete sentence. Other grammar and
punctuation rules for titles and captions are:
Capitalise the first word and proper nouns only.
Donʼt use a full stop to end the title or caption, even if it is a complete sentence.
All titles and captions should have the same:
structure (parallel structure)
terms and shortened forms as those used in the rest of the content (such as acronyms
(/node/190))
font and typeface.
Print considerations
In print, the placement of captions for images is a design consideration. Consult your
organisationʼs visual style guide to find out what you need to do.
Donʼt extend titles or captions beyond the edges of image.An annual report might include a section about the plants of the Snowy Mountains. The
caption describes the image, so the alt text is null.
Caption for annual report: The Hoary sunray has paper-like white flowers
and thrives in the harsh rocky ground on Mount Townsend in summer
Alt text for annual report: alt=""07/09/2024, 14:01 Alt text, captions and titles for images | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/images/alt-text-captions-and-titles-images 9/13Number titles in long documents
Many publications refer to all images as ‘figuresʼ. Complex publications with many images
can use different categories (such as figures, maps or photographs). 
In long-form content, number titles that go with images using ‘figure labelsʼ. You donʼt need
to number images in a brochure, an infographic or a simple, stand-alone page with only a
few images.
The purpose of numbering images is to help people find a specific image. Put the number
before the main text of the image title.
To number an image title in a long document:
Use the ‘Insert captionʼ function in applications to create a label.
Select the ‘Figureʼ label option, and the option to position the label above the image.
Do not select the ‘Exclude label from captionʼ box.
The labels will convert to titles that are automatically numbered and styled for you. Check
that you:
start the numbering at the beginning of the document
use a colon after the number to separate it from the title text
use an initial capital for title text that comes after the colon.
Some disciplines use a full stop after the number. If your organisation uses this style, apply it
consistently.
Use the ‘Cross-referenceʼ function to insert the reference in the body text of the document.
Select ‘Only label and numberʼ so you donʼt include the entire title, only the figure label (for
example, ‘Figure 1ʼ).
These functions keep track of numbering for you. If you move images around in the
document, the numbering updates the cross-references you create to their titles in the body
text.
Number images separately from any numbered tables (/node/45).

Requirements and standards for video and audio
Requirements and standards for
video and audio
Users need transcripts, captions and audio descriptions for accessibility. Work
with experts to record and mix audio. Check branding, copyright and
permissions requirements.
Make sure everyone can access audio
and video
Audio-visual content must have:
a transcript for people who donʼt want to watch the video or listen to the audio – and for
search engine indexing (/node/103)
closed captions for people who canʼt hear the dialogue and other sounds (symbol [CC])
an audio description for people who canʼt see the video.
Audio description is narration. It gives important details that are only visual, usually during
gaps in the dialogue.
Choose an accessible media player that:
can be operated with a keyboard and mouse
can display closed captions
adapts resolutions to support low bandwidth connections07/09/2024, 14:01 Requirements and standards for video and audio | Style Manual

YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo and many other common video platforms often have this
functionality.
Donʼt set video or animation to autoplay. Do not include anything that flashes more than 3
times in any one second period.
Make sure the colour contrast of text in videos is at least 4.5 1.
Normalise your audio to make sure each recording has the same volume.
Remove background sounds or make sure they are at least 20 decibels lower than the
foreground speech content.
Accessibility requirements
User needs:
I can access equivalent information to anything contained in a video or audio file.
I can easily control how I see and hear distinctions if colour or sound convey
meaning.
I can operate the content using only a keyboard.
I can use content without experiencing a seizure or physical reaction.

Have a person transcribe the text. There are many professional services that offer
transcription. If you use automated transcribing software, review it for errors and correct
them.
Format the transcript in plain text or simple HTML.
Consider breaking the transcript into headings and adding time markers. This means
that people can easily find and play a part of the audio.
You can place the transcript on the same page as the content. Alternatively, you can
also add a link below or beside the content to a page with the transcript.07/09/2024, 14:01 Requirements and standards for video and audio | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/video-and-audio/requirements-and-standards-video-and-audio 3/17Include all dialogue and the speakersʼ names. If there is only one speaker, introduce them by
name in the transcript. You can then leave out their name with the dialogue, unless it is
crucial to the content.
Write non-verbal information in square brackets.
End the transcript with ‘End of transcriptʼ.
Include subtitles or captions for video
Subtitles and captions are not the same:
Subtitles display only the dialogue and are commonly used for translations.
Captions display any audio in a video, including dialogue and sound cues.
Captions can be open captions or closed captions.
W3Cʼs Making audio and video media accessible has more instructions at ‘Captions/subtitles

Open captions, which the user cannot turn off, are burned onto the video itself. Closed
captions can be turned on or off by the user.Example
‘… to get to the other side [laughing].ʼ07/09/2024, 14:01 Requirements and standards for video and audio | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/video-and-audio/requirements-and-standards-video-and-audio 4/17If you have a choice, closed captions are preferable to subtitles or open captions. Some
media players also allow for multilingual captions that users can select on demand if they
need translations.
Use Australian terms and spelling for an Australian audience, regardless of the accent or
intention of the speaker. Government agencies might use alternative spellings in video
content for some overseas audiences.
Closed captions come in many file formats. SRT is a common format and is compatible with
most online platforms and media players.
Load the closed caption file onto the video platform as a separate file to the video file. This
allows the user to turn the captions on or off.
You can edit closed caption files.
Time the captions and subtitles to match the dialogue
Keep captions and subtitles short: no more than 2 lines, with no more than 42 characters per
line. Make line breaks where there is a natural break in the sentence (for example, after a
comma).
People read about 2 lines of text in 2 seconds. Test that users can read the captions in the
time available.
Donʼt leave the captions on the screen:
after the speech has finished
across the transition from one scene to the next.
Try to ensure a small break of at least 4 frames between subtitles.
Review and edit the accuracy and synchronised timing of the captions for pre recorded
video.
Centre subtitles and captions at the bottom of the screen
If there are 2 speakers:
give each speaker a separate line and start each line with a dash
align each line to the left of the subtitle block so that their left edges stack above each

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/video-and-audio/requirements-and-standards-video-and-audio 5/17centre the whole subtitle or caption block.
Donʼt use a full stop at the end of subtitles. Use an ellipsis to indicate the end of a
sentence where speech trails off or where a sentence remains unfinished.
Use italics for:
foreign words and phrases
dialogue that is not on the screen, such as a public announcement or dialogue from a
television program.
A hash symbol (#) or a quaver symbol ( ♪ ) show song lyrics.
Add audio description for video
Audio description tells people what is happening in the visual elements of the video. It could
be the only way someone who is blind or has low vision will know visual cues such as the:
setting
costumes
displayed text (such as a sign)
movements.
The audio description describes these visual cues to low-vision users during gaps in the
dialogue.

You donʼt need an audio description for dialogue delivered straight to camera (‘talking
headsʼ).
For anything else, you need to identify who is speaking in the description. If location is
important, include that too.
Use audio description to give context if it is not obvious from the title.
Ensure that:
the content is accurate
the describer speaks clearly.
Include a title, description and metadata
Any video or audio content you publish must have:
a title, description and metadata
an appropriate file name.
The title and description tell people what the content is about. Make sure the title:
has fewer than 70 characters so that search engines can find it
includes keywords
is descriptive, telling users what the content is about.
The description puts the content in context wherever youʼre publishing it. The description
helps users know what theyʼll get out of the content so they can decide whether to view it.
Use the description to explain if the content is part of a series and tell people how they can
subscribe. You can also add:

links to related webpages.
Each file format has different metadata fields. Metadata tags store specific information about
the file, like the:
creation date
creator
owner
talent
file size
file name.
Some fill automatically, such as the creation date. Youʼll have to fill other fields manually.
Search engines use information from metadata to include files in searches.
Information management requirements
You must use the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) when preparing
government information (https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/information/sensitive-
classified-information/Pages/default.aspx). The PSPF covers how information is
classified and marked, and what this means for its storage, handling, access and
disposal. Consult the PSPF webpages or your organisationʼs protective security policy.
You must also follow your organisationʼs information management requirements.
Information (including data) that you create as part of your work for the Australian
Government is a record. It provides evidence of what your organisation has done and
why.
Managing and disposing of records properly is a requirement under the Archives Act
1983 (https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A02796). For guidance, visit the
National Archives of Australia website for content on information management
standards (https://www.naa.gov.au/information-management/information-
management-standards).07/09/2024, 14:01 Requirements and standards for video and audio | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/video-and-audio/requirements-and-standards-video-and-audio 8/17Store video in a standard file format
All video should be in MP4 (MPEG4), a commercial and commonly used video file format.
MP4 is a compressed digital video file format that allows streaming and downloading of
videos from the internet. Most mobile devices support MP4 videos without people having to
install an application (app) to play them. MP4 also supports metadata tags, attachments and
interactive menus.
Meet common audio-only technical
specifications
Audio-only content must meet common technical specifications (specs) for publishing on
different platforms:
Government agencies have internal guidelines for publishing audio on their websites.
Audio hosting platforms have their own spec lists for audio quality.
Use a booth or studio if you can
It is best to record audio in a sound booth or recording studio. If you donʼt have access to
either, choose an environment you can control.
Recording in quiet environments makes it easier to understand the dialogue. Donʼt record in
windy conditions and environments with:
background noise from air conditioners
background noise from people talking
hard surfaces such as glass and concrete, because sound bounces off them.
Location noise is sometimes used in audio to set the scene or to indicate a time progression.
Including this is a job for audio professionals.
Donʼt record in noisy environments. Instead, record in quiet spaces with soft furnishings
such as carpets or fabric, because they absorb sound.07/09/2024, 14:01 Requirements and standards for video and audio | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/video-and-audio/requirements-and-standards-video-and-audio 9/17Get expert help to edit and mix audio
The aim of audio editing is to produce audio that:
is clear and technically balanced
sounds natural while telling a cohesive and engaging story.
Whoever edits the audio must have the technical expertise to meet the accessibility and
technical standards required. They will be familiar with audio editing tools, including
restoration and enhancement software.
If the audio includes music or sound effects, you must still be able to hear and understand
the person speaking. If several people are speaking, it should be easy to tell each personʼs
voice from the other.
Mix historical audio to match the same level of decibels as the rest of the recording.
Accessibility relates closely to technical standards for audio. W3Cʼs Making audio and video
media accessible gives an overview of the relationship in ‘Audio content and video content
(https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/av-content/)ʼ.
Accessibility requirements
User needs:
I can easily control how I see and hear distinctions if colour or sound convey meaning.
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:
1.4.7 Low or no background audio – level AAA
(https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?
showtechniques=124%2C129%2C121#low-or-no-background-audio)
Apply government branding to all audio
and video
Branding applies to all government content, regardless of the platform that supports access
to the content.07/09/2024, 14:01 Requirements and standards for video and audio | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/video-and-audio/requirements-and-standards-video-and-audio 10/17Text in video
Style all text in videos:
with clear and simple fonts (sans serif is usually the best choice)
to ensure that the text contrasts strongly with the background.
Accessibility requirements
User needs:
I can easily control how I see and hear distinctions if colour or sound convey meaning.
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criteria:
1.4.3 Contrast (minimum) – level AA (https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?
showtechniques=124%2C129%2C121#contrast-minimum)
Avoid effects if they make the text less readable. Seek expert advice if you plan to use text
effects (such as drop shadows, outlines and tinted blocks). If they are well designed, they
can help give enough contrast and separation to make the text easier to read. Poorly
designed text effects can make text very difficult to read.
Avoid colours that make the video less accessible for some users. For example, avoid using
red and green as the only way to convey meaning.
Visual identifiers
Use your organisationʼs branding guidelines to make sure any video is clearly government
content. Visual branding tells people that video is created on behalf of the Australian
Government.
Check that all text complies with your organisationʼs branding guidelines. This includes text
formatting and spelling. In this way, the video text is consistent with other content that your
organisation publishes.
Branded sounds
Check if your agency has ‘brandedʼ sounds (also called audio logos). These help users
immediately associate audio-visual or audio-only content with your agency.07/09/2024, 14:01 Requirements and standards for video and audio | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/video-and-audio/requirements-and-standards-video-and-audio 11/17Branded sounds occur at the very beginning or end of the content. They need to be short
(no longer than 6 seconds) and provide a consistent identity for your organisation.
Set the video aspect and resolution for
the userʼs device
Whether you publish the video on a platform or your agency website, you will need to
consider aspect ratio and resolution. Videos are more usable if they use as much of the
screen space as possible.
Most people use their mobile devices (phones and tablets) to access social media
(/node/43). Square videos (with a 1 1 aspect ratio) are popular on Instagram. Vertical videos
(with a 9 16 aspect ratio) are popular in the Stories feature in Facebook, YouTube, Instagram
and other platforms.
The videos you access on a desktop computer are usually a horizontal rectangle. They
usually have a 16 9 horizontal aspect ratio, with a minimum resolution of 1,920 pixels wide by
1,080 pixels high.
Figure: Aspect ratios for horizontal and vertical display on mobile devices
Introduce speakers in the video using
text and graphics (lower thirds)
‘Lower thirdsʼ is the term for a graphic and text overlay that show a speakerʼs name,
organisation and role. Using lower thirds is mandatory. They are usually an image file added
into the video editing application.07/09/2024, 14:01 Requirements and standards for video and audio | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/video-and-audio/requirements-and-standards-video-and-audio 12/17Despite the name, lower thirds donʼt have to be in the lower third of the screen. Be guided by
where the personʼs face appears. They must appear in the ‘title-safeʼ area. This is the area
within a video frame where you can put text without the edges of the screen cutting it off.
When adding a lower third to a video, a title-safe guide in the editing application appears
over the text to help position it.
Be careful when lower thirds appear on the screen: donʼt obscure the videoʼs captions and
subtitles.
For interviews or ‘talking headsʼ, the usual style is to place the speakerʼs name on the top
line. Place the speakerʼs title and organisation on the second line.
Lower thirds must:
be appropriate for government content
be correct
be as short as possible
have a strong contrast with the videoʼs background
use a text font that is readable at smaller resolutions or when compressed.
A sans serif font is the easiest to read, but use your organisationʼs branding and style.
Get permissions and licences for
copyright material
You must have a signed release from people who appear in a video. This includes everyone
who is filmed and people whose voices have been recorded. Keep the signed release
form and give a copy to the person who signed it.
Privacy requirements
Your organisation has obligations under the Privacy Act 1988
(https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/).
Privacy is relevant whenever itʼs possible to identify someone. Treat things that can or
might identify an individual as personal information. Personal information can include
things like a voice recording or someoneʼs appearance.07/09/2024, 14:01 Requirements and standards for video and audio | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/video-and-audio/requirements-and-standards-video-and-audio 13/17When you handle personal information, you must comply with the Australian Privacy
Principles (https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/). Personal
information is any information that could identify an individual, in any format.
Other restrictions might apply to copyright.
Some donors of material to collecting institutions may have restricted its use. Donors may
also need to give written permission before you use material. Check with the collecting
institution.
Before you use First Nations Australiansʼ content, you need proper permissions. Always
consult with relevant communities (or individuals) and copyright holders. The permissions
process is vital and differs from standard copyright procedures
(/node/179#consultation_is_a_must). 
Copyright requirements
You must get permission (a licence) to use copyright material. This includes text,
lyrics, images, video and sounds.
You must choose a licence to release copyright materials. If you work in government,
use an open access licence if you can (for example, Creative Commons
(https://creativecommons.org.au/)).
Read the government copyright rules in the Australian Government intellectual
property manual (https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/media-
centre/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).
Use stock video if it enhances the
production
Stock video is short content that you have not produced. Using stock video can save
production time and money.
Government has its own stock video resources of large audiovisual collections, dating back
to the 1890s. Collections cover a wide range of topics about Australian life, culture and
history. For research support and usage terms and conditions, contact the respective access07/09/2024, 14:01 Requirements and standards for video and audio | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/content-types/video-and-audio/requirements-and-standards-video-and-audio 14/17teams at the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia (https://www.nfsa.gov.au/) and the
National Archives of Australia (https://www.naa.gov.au/).
Be careful with commercial stock video. People will identify and dismiss stock video that
looks as if it is not Australian or doesnʼt seem genuine.
Other than historical material, ensure that stock video:
is crisp
has natural colours
focuses on people
meets common technical standards
is visibly Australian.
To use a stock video, you must purchase a licence from its owner. Some stock video has a
Creative Commons licence.

Types of structure
Structure supports the user as they search for information. Use the type of
structure that suits the content and how people will need to consume it.
Structure content to help the user to
navigate and understand
Structure helps people find information (/node/74). It helps people to understand and use
content by:
preparing them for what they will read
helping them navigate and scan content
helping them remember what theyʼve read.
Structure also helps search engines (/node/72). They use structure to find and rank content
in a search results listing.
Accessibility requirements
User needs:
I can change the content's presentation without losing information or structure.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/types-structure 1/6Write clear page titles. The title is the first thing a screen reader user will hear
and is the first item to appear in search results.
Organise content in a clear order using section headings. Describe the topics or
the following section in the headings.
Make sure all users can navigate through all content in the intended order,
regardless of the technology they're using. Use the same navigation elements
across services.

Pick the type of structure that works for
the user
Use a structure that matches expectations for the type of content you're creating:
To group content into topics or connected ideas, prioritised by level of importance, use
a hierarchical structure (/node/79). People will scan content for relevance to them.
Some will use screen readers to list headings in order to understand the content at a
high level. Hierarchical structure is economical for people with low attention span, who
are time-poor or need to use assistive technologies.
To present a sequence of steps or events, use a sequential structure (/node/78). People
will need to know or do something with the content that is presented as instructional
and ordered. Sequential structure helps people know where they are in a process
towards a given result.07/09/2024, 14:01 Types of structure | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/types-structure 2/6To guide people from beginning to end, use a narrative structure (/node/80). People will
be interested in knowing the entire story. They will expect signposts that suggest where
they are in the journey for ease of reference.
Avoid unconventional or inconsistent structures. They make people work harder to find and
understand content. Do user research to understand who will be using the content and their
level of literacy (/node/62). 
Your organisation might have templates for content such as reports (/node/47), letters and
emails (/node/50). Structural elements are built into those templates.
Design headings and other elements to
help the user scan the page
Once you have decided on the type of structure you need to use, plan the structural
elements.
Use a logical hierarchy or sequential steps for headings (/node/51).
Write a topic sentence for each paragraph (/node/53). 
Display important information in lists (/node/56), callout boxes (/node/58), tables
(/node/45) and illustrations (/node/46). 
Structure your content by writing about one idea at a time:
Start with the most important idea first.
Group related ideas under headings (/node/51).
Organise ideas into short paragraphs (/node/53).
Make sure ideas flow from one paragraph to the next.
Use a logical order for sentences (/node/120).

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/types-structure 3/6The sixth edition had advice on inductive and deductive patterns of writing, and on linear
and non-linear structures. These are not covered in the digital edition.
The digital edition builds on a short paragraph from the sixth edition about sequential
structure. It also has more concise information on hierarchical structure. 
The Content Guide did not have advice on these topics.

Headings
Headings help users scan content and find what they need. Organise content
using clear heading levels. Begin each heading with keywords and keep it to the
point.
Write headings that are clear and short
Headings organise information. Clear headings are specific to the topic they describe.
Keep them brief. They are signposts for people and for search engines.
Many people skim through headings to check whether a page is relevant before they read it
in detail. Search engines use headings to analyse and rank content.
Accessibility requirements
User needs:
I can change the content's presentation without losing information or structure.
I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.
Fundamentals:
Write clear page titles. This is the first topic a screen reader user will hear and
should align with the first heading on the page.
Organise content with a clear structure using section headings. Clearly describe
the topics or the following section in the headings.07/09/2024, 14:02 Headings | Style Manual

(https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#section-headings)
State the main point
Write headings that tell the user what is in the content below it.
Headings should state the main point. This helps users find and use content in search results
and on social media.
Use words that accurately describe the content. Donʼt use empty words or phrases (for
example, ‘moreʼ or ‘related informationʼ).
Only include information in the section that is relevant to the heading. If the information isnʼt
relevant, move it or rewrite the heading.
Use fewer than 70 characters
Write headings that are no more than 70 characters (including spaces).Like this

More information07/09/2024, 14:02 Headings | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/headings 2/11Longer headings are more difficult to read and can be confusing. They might also suggest
that you have too many ideas in a section.
Avoid questions as headings
Using questions pushes your main idea towards the end of the heading.
Starting a heading with ‘whyʼ, ‘howʼ or ‘whatʼ makes it slower for the user to read. They have
to read the whole heading before finding relevant keywords.
Use keywords to start headings
Start headings and subheadings with keywords that help people to make a connection.
People scan-read headings to know the relevance of the content. If they use assistive
technologies, they might use the tab key to read from heading to heading. Others who use
screen readers might generate a list of headings for quick navigation.
The keywords should relate to the main content below the heading. Pay special attention to
the first 2 or 3 words. These might be the only words someone reads to decide whether to
continue to scan the page or to read the text.
Using keywords at the start of a heading is called ‘frontloadingʼ. Frontloading makes it easier
for people to assess the headingʼs relevance – either on a web page or in search results. It
also helps search engines find your content (/node/72).
Organise heading levels in a logical order
Heading hierarchy is the relationship between main headings and subheadings. The
hierarchical structure shows users how topics fit together (/node/79). Write this

Not this
Write a heading starting with the main keywords07/09/2024, 14:02 Headings | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/headings 3/11A clear and logical heading hierarchy shows readers where to find information and how
important it is.
Keep each section concise and use headings to chunk information so it works well on screen
for the user.
Heading levels include main titles, headings and subheadings:
Level 1 headings are titles of webpages or titles of chapters in a book or printed report
(/node/47).
Level 2 headings are main headings.
Level 3 headings are subheadings.
Level 4 headings are sub-subheadings (headings under subheadings).
Donʼt skip heading levels
Write headings in a complete organised hierarchy.
A complete hierarchy helps people scan the content to find the information they need.
Screen reader users need to be able to rely on heading level hierarchy to find relevant
content.
Use one level 1 heading
Use just one level 1 heading per webpage. Make it unique to your site. This helps users
understand the content and find it using search engines.
The level 1 heading is also a good place to include target keywords needed for search engine
optimisation (/node/103).
Print considerations
In documents, use level 1 headings (or ‘Heading 1ʼ style) for the main sections, such
as part titles.
Make the headings relate
Every heading and subheading must relate to the heading above it so the grouping of
information is logical and clear for users.07/09/2024, 14:02 Headings | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/headings 4/11Avoid level 5 and deeper heading levels
Try to use only 3 or 4 heading levels at the most. A simpler structure is easier to read.
You can use deeper heading levels (level 4 and below) for very complex documents, but try
to avoid it.
Deep and complex hierarchies of headings are a sign that you are probably trying to do too
much on a webpage or in a chapter. It is likely that you will lose the reader.
Space out headings
Separate each heading from the next one by some text, even if itʼs only a sentence. This
helps create a clear distinction between ideas.
Create at least 2 headings for each level
Give each heading level in a section at least one other heading at the same level. This avoids
the appearance of stranded ideas.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/headings 5/11Use numbered headings only for steps
Use numbered headings only when they relate to a series of steps. Numbered headings can
help users through a sequential structure (/node/78).
Print considerations
In print, you can use numbered headings to help people cross-reference information:
If you use numbered headings, use them only in the body.
Donʼt use numbered headings in the preliminary pages or endmatter in a report.
Donʼt number more than the first 3 heading levels.
Be consistent: use a parallel structure
All headings in a level should be consistent.
They should have the same:
overall message (for example, they are all steps in a process)
grammatical form (called ‘parallel structureʼ).
Two common forms are:
noun phrases (for example, ‘effective headingsʼ and ‘punctuation and capitalisationʼ)
instructions (for example, ‘keep headings shortʼ and ‘be consistentʼ).H5: Practise for the test

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/headings 6/11Use unique formatting for each level of
heading
Format headings so the heading levels are visibly different. This helps users scan the text.
People should be able to tell the difference between heading levels at a glance.
Formatting options include:
font weights and sizes that are distinct from one another – a larger, bolder font for main
headings and a smaller, lighter font for lower-level subheadings
colour to help people scan the headings – but donʼt rely on colour as the only way to
differentiate heading levels
spacing above a heading to help people see the visual break from one section to the
next.
Donʼt add an underline
Donʼt underline headings or any other text.
Underlined text looks like a hyperlink, which can confuse users. It also makes it harder to
read letters with descenders (for example, ‘pʼ, ‘yʼ and ‘gʼ in ‘Applying for government
supportʼ).
Apply HTML elements, tags and styles to headings
Use styles, tags and HTML elements to identify headings in digital content.
Correctly styled and tagged headings:
make it easy to create consistent headings

are needed for accessibility of digital content
help search engines understand the topic that youʼre writing about.
Print considerations
Correctly styled headings make it easier for graphic designers to know how to lay out
the publication, including what weighting to give each heading.07/09/2024, 14:02 Headings | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/headings 7/11The reader should see at least one heading on each double-page spread in a printed
document.
Donʼt leave a heading at the bottom of the page with no text below it. Send the
heading to the top of the next page so it stays with the content below it.
HTML elements
Use the correct HTML element for the heading level.
Your content management system should have inbuilt heading styles that you can apply to
text.
System heading styles
Apply correct inbuilt heading styles so they can be automatically added to navigation and
contents pages.
If your organisation uses templates, use the template styles.
Print considerations
Some organisations have their own heading style guidelines.
If no guidelines apply, use a ‘Heading 1ʼ style for the main sections in the document.
The title of a document uses the ‘Titleʼ style.Example
A page about paying your tax might use these headings:
H1 = ‘Lodging your tax returnʼ (the page title)
H2 = ‘Individual tax returnʼ (a heading for a main section)
H3 = ‘Lodging onlineʼ (a subheading)
H4 = ‘Creating an accountʼ (a sub-subheading)07/09/2024, 14:02 Headings | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/headings 8/11Write all headings in sentence case and
use minimal punctuation
Use sentence case for headings to help people read the text more easily.
This means you should use a capital letter only for:
the first letter of the first word
(/node/116#capitalise_the_first_word_in_a_sentence_and_in_headings)
the first letter of any proper nouns (/node/122)
letters in acronyms and initialisms (/node/190).
Donʼt write headings in all capital letters as users could misread words. For example, ‘ACTʼ
could be ‘actʼ (the verb) rather than the initialism for the Australian Capital Territory.
If you work for an organisation that uses all capitals for headings, make sure any
abbreviations are easy to understand.
Donʼt use a full stop to end headings
Even if the heading is a sentence, it doesnʼt need a full stop at the end.
Avoid using shortened forms in headings
Donʼt use a shortened form in a heading unless it is better known than the full term (for
example, ‘DNAʼ and ‘CSIROʼ).

Links
Links can help users navigate content. Include links when they support user
journeys and for search engine optimisation. Write link text that is accurate and
accessible.
Link to something only if it helps meet
the userʼs need
Links (hyperlinks) are words or images that users can click to go to other content.
Links help people navigate digital services or products. But they can also reduce readability
and increase cognitive load. For this reason, use them only when they support a user need.
Links are also important for search engine optimisation
(/node/71/#create_useful_links_to_highquality_content). Search engines use links to:
discover webpages
determine how they rank in search results.
Use text for links in most cases. These links are called anchor text.
Use images for links only if they meet a user need. If you do use images, accurately describe
the link with alt text (/node/49). Donʼt describe the image itself.07/09/2024, 14:02 Links | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/links 1/11Digital Service Standard requirements
You must understand users and their context for using the service to meet the Digital
Service Standard: Criterion 1. Understand user needs (https://www.dta.gov.au/help-
and-advice/digital-service-standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/1-understand-
user-needs).
Do research with users to understand the task they are trying to do and how they
navigate through your end-to-end service or product.
Link to a different site only if essential
External links connect pages on a website to those on other domains. Use them only when
they are an essential part of the user journey.
Include external links when the user needs:
to complete their task on an external website
to access original, authoritative information thatʼs provided by another government
agency or external source.
Follow your agencyʼs external linking policy when linking to non-government websites. Avoid
implying endorsement to commercial websites in external links.
Link to sources instead of duplicating them
When planning content, find out if similar information already exists. If it does, link to it rather
than duplicating it.
Duplicated content is confusing because itʼs not clear to the user which page is the
authoritative source. This can cause users to abandon digital services.
Duplicated content also requires resources to maintain, as it can become out of date easily.
Link directly to the specific page that the user needs to go to, not the homepage. This is
known as ‘deep linkingʼ.07/09/2024, 14:02 Links | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/links 2/11Include document title, file type and size when linking to files
Provide content in HTML format by default (/format-writing-and-structure/content-
formats/reports#consider_publishing_format). This has benefits for both accessibility and
maintenance. If a full HTML version of the file is not available, link to a summary page if it
exists. 
There will be some situations in which you need to link to non-HTML documents and files.
Give users the information they need to decide whether to download the file by providing
the:
document title (not the file name)
the file type
the file size in kilobytes (kB) or megabytes (MB).
Include all this information in the link text, but remember that this adds extra information for
all users. Minimise the number of links where you can.
You donʼt need to explain ‘kBʼ and ‘MBʼ as they are units of measurement (/node/147). ‘PDFʼ,
‘DOCXʼ and other common file types are widely recognised. If your website uses an unusual
or specialist file type, consider explaining this in your support pages.
Take care when using file type icons
For some users, file type icons can be a useful way of recognising different kinds of files.
These icons have disadvantages though:
File type icons can create ‘clutterʼ for users, including those who use assistive
technology. This is especially true when there are lists of links.
File type icons are images and require the same consideration for all images on
websites (/node/49). This includes alternative text.
File type icons may require resources to apply and maintain. They can be difficult for
content authors to use if your content management system does not apply them
automatically.Example

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/links 3/11They may not support the branding or overall look and feel of your site. There is a large
variety of icons available and selecting or designing an inappropriate icon may confuse
users.
Write link text that makes the
destination clear
Users scan content for links to understand what it is about. People who use assistive
technologies often use the tab key to read from link to link. People who use screen readers
often generate a list of links for quick navigation.
For these reasons, links need to make sense when read out of the context of surrounding
content. Links like ‘click hereʼ or ‘more informationʼ donʼt give the user any information about
the destination.
Write link text that describes the destination in clear language. Match the content on the
linked page so the user knows they have reached the right place.
Accessibility requirements
User need:
I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.
Fundamentals:
Write link text that makes the destination and purpose of the link clear.
All users must be able to understand the purpose of a link without extra context.

Donʼt use exit modals
An ‘exit modalʼ or ‘exit pop-upʼ is an alert that appears on the userʼs browser when they
select a link to an external website.
Donʼt use these to tell users they are leaving your site when they use external links. Make it
clear in your text that the link is external and explain why you have included it. These pop-
ups interrupt users, overemphasise the transition and can make users feel lost and
confused.
You should also consider developing a policy to explain to users how your site approaches
and presents links to government and non-government content.
Include keywords at the start of links
People usually only read the first few words of links. Keep them concise and put the most
important words at the start of the link.
Using relevant words at the start of links is called ‘frontloadingʼ. Frontloading makes it easier
for people to scan and find what theyʼre looking for. It also helps them to read and assess the
linkʼs relevance.
Write links that are about a single idea, to help people to decide whether to click. Only link
the keywords.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/links 5/11Put most links at the end of sentences
Links reduce readability because they are distracting. They also make it easy for users to
click away before they have read all your content.
If itʼs important for users to understand all your content, put links at the end of sentences.
If a link makes more sense at the start of a sentence, consider if everything in the sentence
is essential.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/links 6/11Link email addresses not names
To link to an email address, use the email address as the link text so itʼs not mistaken for a
website address. 
Use the mailto: prefix in the URL but not in the link text.
Open links in the same browser tab or
window
Set links to open in the same browser window or tab by default. This prevents users from
becoming disoriented and allows them to use the ‘backʼ button if needed. This is the default
behaviour for links created using the <a> (anchor) HTML tag.
Consider carefully how users move through your website before you set a link to open in a
new tab or window. Whether a user decides to open a link in a new browser tab or window
depends heavily on the task they are trying to complete. Some examples are:
logging on to a secure website
giving information that would disrupt a multi-step process, such as filling out a form
downloading a document.
In all cases, give users contextual information in the link to explain why a link will open in a
new window or tab.Write this

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/links 7/11Create internal links that support the
userʼs journey
Internal links connect pages on the same website. They help users and search engine find
and navigate your content.
Build internal links to help users move through each stage of the user journey. Use them to
help users:
orient themselves when using your digital product or service
move sequentially through a step-by-step task
find information thatʼs directly related to a topic.
Use the same homepage links across the site
You must include a homepage link in your main navigation. This helps users when they
become lost or want to start a new task.
Add homepage links to the agency name or site title and the Commonwealth Coat of Arms
image. Place these links in the top left part of the page.
Add in-page links only if they help the user navigate
In-page links (anchor links or bookmark links) connect to content on the same page. Useful
in-page links include:
tables of contents
back-to-top links.
In-page links can be helpful when content is lengthy. But they can also be disorienting if
users expect to go to a different page. Test content with users. Shorter content may better
meet their needs.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/links 8/11The sixth edition guidance focused on hyperlinks in the context of creating material
specifically for on-screen use. It made a distinction between ‘information hyperlinksʼ and
‘navigation hyperlinksʼ that is not used in the digital edition.
The Content Guide had advice on using hypertext and hyperlinks.

Lists
Lists make it easy for users to scan and understand a series of items. Structure
and style lists with the user in mind. Set up grammatical structure for list items
with a lead-in.
Structure items in a series as a list
Lists are series of items. All lists have a 'lead-in' (a phrase or sentence) or heading to
introduce the list.
Use lists to:
help users skim information
group related information
help users understand how items relate to each other
show an order of steps
arrange information by importance.
Lists can be ordered or numbered (the order is important) or unordered (the order is not
critical).
A bullet list can be ordered or unordered.
A numbered list is always ordered.
Donʼt use a list if you have only one item. Lists are only for a series of items.07/09/2024, 14:02 Lists | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/lists 1/15Accessibility requirements
User need: 
Fundamental requirement: use lists to make it easier for users to skim content and
navigate pages.
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines success criterion: 1.3.1 Info and relationships –
level A (https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#info-and-relationships).
Make short lists
Long lists can lose meaning and hierarchy, as lower items are further away from the lead-in. 
Move long lists to a separate page or an appendix.
Limit the number of lists
Content with too many lists is hard to follow. The content should flow so people can read it
easily.
Use a consistent pattern for list items
Write items in a list so they follow a consistent pattern. The pattern is made up by the
number of words you use and grammatical structure.
If items follow a consistent pattern, it makes a list easier to scan and understand.
Write list items so they have parallel
structure
Write all list items so they have the same grammatical structure. This is called ‘parallel
structureʼ. It makes lists easier to read.
To make a parallel structure, use the same:
word type to start each item (such as a noun or a verb)
tense for each item (past, present or future)07/09/2024, 14:02 Lists | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/lists 2/15sentence type (such as a question, direction or statement).
Move any words repeated in the list items to the lead-in.
Punctuate lists according to style
Unnecessary punctuation makes your list look cluttered. Current government style is for
minimal punctuation.
Punctuate lead-ins and headings consistently
Phrase lead-ins always end in a colon (:).
Sentence lead-ins can end in a colon or a full stop. Choose one punctuation mark and use it
for all sentence lead-ins in your document. If in doubt, choose a colon; it is used more
commonly.
Headings do not have punctuation marks.Write this

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/lists 3/15Use minimal punctuation for all lists
In a bullet or numbered list, donʼt use:
semicolons (;) or commas (,) at the end of list items
‘andʼ or ‘orʼ after list items.
Only include ‘andʼ or ‘orʼ after the second-last list item if it is critical to meaning – for
example, you are writing in a legal context. Make sure the lead-in is a clear guide for how this
kind of list should be interpreted.
Lead-ins for incomplete lists can use ‘for exampleʼ, ‘includingʼ or ‘includesʼ.
Donʼt write ‘etc.ʼ at the end of the list to show the list is incomplete. 
When listing items that may be additional or optional, write a lead-in to explain any variables.
Use full stops to complete sentences and fragment lists
Sentence lists and fragment lists are 2 types of list that use full stops.
Finish each item in a sentence list with a full stop, including the last one.
Finish fragment lists with a full stop only after the last item.
If you donʼt include the full stop, people using screen readers may assume the next
paragraph is part of the list.
A stand-alone list is a third type of list. Stand-alone lists donʼt end in a full stop.Example
Select your preference from one of these options: [Lead-in with many options]
Please write your response to any 3 of the following questions: [Lead-in with a specific
number of options]
Applicants need to choose between either: [Lead-in with a choice between 2 options]07/09/2024, 14:02 Lists | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/lists 4/15Choose a type of list
There are different ways to construct a list, whether the list is ordered or unordered.
Types of list include:
sentence lists
fragment lists
stand-alone lists.
Use sentence lists for a series of complete sentences
If you have a paragraph with a series of related sentences, you can consider breaking it into
a sentence list.
Sentence lists have a list of sentences, each marked by bullets or numbers.
The list can have a:
heading (without a colon or full stop)
sentence lead-in (ending in a colon or full stop)
phrase lead-in (ending in a colon).
Rules for sentence lists:
Follow normal sentence structure in each list item.
Start each list item with a capital letter and end it with a full stop.
Align run-over lines with the text, not the bullet or number.
Avoid using multiple sentences in each bullet or numbered item. If you include more than one
sentence per list item, consider whether:
all list items conform to a similar pattern
the list builds rhythm for readability
(/node/60#rhythm_changes_can_help_or_hinder_reading).

Actions for the committee [Heading without a colon before an ordered sentence list]07/09/2024, 14:02 Lists | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/lists 5/15Use full sentence list items for imperative list items where there is no stated subject in the
lead-in.
Use fragment lists for a series of incomplete sentences
If you list more than 3 items in a sentence, consider breaking the sentence into a fragment
list. This will aid readability.
Fragments are words, phrases or incomplete sentences. Another name for fragment lists is
‘phrase listsʼ.
Fragment lists have a:
lead-in phrase or sentence followed by a colon
list of fragments, each marked by a bullet. . The secretary will respond to each recommendation.
 . The secretary will allocate responses that need more work to members.
 . Members will discuss the recommendations at the next meeting on 9 March.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/lists 6/15Use fragment list items when the lead-in states the grammatical subject
(/node/120#a_full_sentence_is_grammatically_complete).
Rules for fragment lists:
Use lower case for the first letter of each fragment, unless itʼs a proper noun.
Add a full stop to the last list item only.
Use a grammatically parallel structure for each list item.
Make sure each fragment can complete a phrase lead-in.
The last rule for fragment lists means that if you add each fragment to a phrase lead-in, it
will make a complete sentence.
If list items run-on from a phrase lead-in, the list should be very short. The full sentence
should be fewer than 25 words.Example
Writers should become familiar with the conventional types of content structure:
hierarchical
sequential
narrative.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/lists 7/15Use stand-alone lists for items under a heading
If you are not breaking up a paragraph or a sentence, consider a stand-alone list.
Stand-alone lists have a heading without a colon. Brochures and technical documents often
contain stand-alone lists.
Items in stand-alone lists can be nouns or noun phrases. They can also be sentence
fragments. Items cannot be full sentences.
Rules for stand-alone lists:
Use a heading, not a lead-in.
Start each list item with a capital letter.
Donʼt add full stops to the end of any of the list items (even the last item).
Indent each list item if it helps people scan the content.Queensland is famous for its beautiful beaches.]
Not this
Queensland is famous for its:
islands and coral reefs
experience the tropical rainforest
the wildlife. It can kill you.
beautiful beaches.
[If you combine the lead-in with each fragment, the second sentence doesnʼt make
sense, ‘Queensland is famous for its ... experience the tropical rainforestʼ. Neither does
the third sentence, ‘Queensland is famous for its ... the wildlife. It can kill you.ʼ]
Example

Order stationery07/09/2024, 14:02 Lists | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/lists 8/15The differences between a fragment list and a stand-alone list are:
A fragment list has a sentence or phrase lead-in.
A stand-alone list has no lead-in, only a heading.
Fragment list items complete phrase lead-ins to form a grammatical sentence.
Stand-alone list items do not form a grammatical sentence.
Use consistent formatting for all lists
Sometimes you need to use different types of lists in the same piece of content.
Use the right punctuation and capital letters for each type of list.
Follow your organisationʼs templates to format lists consistently.
Make sure lists conform to their type
Each list must look the same as other lists of the same type. For example, a fragment list
needs to have the same format as other fragment lists. 
Consistency helps people scan lists.
Check that the list displays properly on all platforms.
Indent most lists
Indent most types of lists after the lead-in.
Indent stand-alone lists if it helps the user scan the list.
Write numbered lists if the order is
critical
Use a numbered (ordered) list when the order is important, such as a list of instructions.Take meeting minutes07/09/2024, 14:02 Lists | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/lists 9/15Sometimes you have more than one numbered list in the document. You must choose
whether to continue or reset the numbering across the lists.
Avoid using in-line numbered lists
Break up text into a numbered list instead of using an in-line numbered list. This will aid
readability.
To order points in general content, donʼt use ordinal numbers (/node/162). Instead, you can
either:
use a numbered list
rephrase the sentences to link them in the same paragraph.Example
How to register for the conference:
 . Choose the days you will attend.
 . Pick the workshops you want to join.
 . Enter your discount code (if you have one).
[This list is numbered because users must complete each step in turn.]
Write this
The facilitator will:
 . welcome participants to the conference
 . introduce each of the speakers.
[A numbered list]
Not this
The facilitator will 1) welcome participants to the conference, and 2) introduce each of
the speakers.
[An in-line numbered list]07/09/2024, 14:02 Lists | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/lists 10/15Put unordered lists in a sequence that helps the user
Use an unordered list if the order is not critical to understanding the content.
List items in the order that will make sense to the user reading it. Itʼs common to write lists in
alphabetical order.Write this
The facilitator will welcome participants to the conference. Next, they will introduce each
of the speakers.
[The sentences are linked as a sequence with ‘nextʼ (an adverb (/node/127)).]
Not this
The facilitator will firstly welcome participants to the conference. Secondly, they will
introduce each of the speakers.
[The ordinals use more words than necessary
(/node/204#eliminate_unnecessary_words). They also affect tone (/node/40).]
Example
National parks near Perth
Avon Valley National Park
Serpentine National Park
Walyunga National Park
Yanchep National Park
[This stand-alone list uses an alphabetical order, which is easy for users to follow.
Context might give you a reason to use a different order for the same list of national
parks. For example, you could also sort them by proximity to Perth.]07/09/2024, 14:02 Lists | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/lists 11/15Avoid using a multilevel list
Multilevel lists group information into a hierarchy. The levels explain how each item relates to
other list items.
Some types of content need multilevel lists, but they can be hard for people to follow.
If you have to use multilevel lists:
Donʼt use more than 2 levels.
Use lowercase letters for the second level in a numbered list.
Use a dash for the second level in a bullet list, not hollow (open) bullets.
Use the same symbol, number or letter for the same level in each list.
Like this
There are many types of birds in Australia, including:
nocturnal birds
– frogmouths
– nightjars
– owls 
marsh birds
– crakes
– grebes
– snipes.

Paragraphs
One idea per paragraph helps users absorb information. Organise them under
headings to help users scan the content. Write short paragraphs, each with a
topic sentence.
Limit each paragraph to one idea
People find it easier to understand content when a paragraph contains only one idea or
theme. Donʼt introduce a new idea in the middle or at the end of a paragraph. Start a new
paragraph instead.
Introduction or summary paragraphs recap ideas covered in the content. Group sentences in
these paragraphs by theme – for example, to help users understand how the content is
structured (/node/75).
Put paragraphs in the order that makes
sense to the user
Order paragraphs in a logical sequence, such as:
steps in a transaction
the order of importance
cause then effect
problem then solution
pros then cons.07/09/2024, 14:02 Paragraphs | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/paragraphs 1/7This helps people follow related ideas or steps in a sequence (/node/78).
Expand on the heading in the first
paragraph
The first paragraph under a heading helps people decide if theyʼve found the information
they need. Search engines also use first paragraphs when analysing content.
Use the first paragraph to make the purpose of your content easier to find in searches
(/node/72). It should include a topic sentence and summarise the following paragraphs.
You can use first paragraphs to improve long-form content, such as reports. First paragraphs
can summarise the main points in each section. 
Copy and paste all the first paragraphs together to compile a summary of your content. If
youʼre missing any main points, rewrite some of your first paragraphs.
Introduce the main idea in the topic
sentence
The first sentence in each paragraph should be the topic sentence. The topic sentence helps
people follow the meaning of your writing as they skim content.
Each paragraph should contain only the information that relates to the topic sentence.
To write an effective topic sentence, write it in the active voice
(/node/204#write_in_active_voice). This approach makes the main idea in the paragraph the
grammatical subject of the topic sentence
(/node/120#passive_voice_changes_standard_sentence_order).
Write this
Our rapid response team began operating in 2019 as a result of the 2018 stakeholder
survey. The survey showed it took too long to repair damage.07/09/2024, 14:02 Paragraphs | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/paragraphs 2/7Take care if starting a paragraph with a pronoun (/node/131). It should already be clear who
or what the pronoun is referring to. If not, make sure to mention the noun in each paragraph
before using the pronoun that substitutes the noun (/node/122).Not this
A stakeholder survey in 2018 revealed dissatisfaction with the time taken to repair

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/paragraphs 3/7Keep most paragraphs to 2 or 3
sentences
Short paragraphs help people understand content. The ideal length depends on what you
are writing:
Media releases and news articles have only one or 2 sentences in a paragraph.
Content designed for mobile screens has no more than 2 or 3 sentences in a
paragraph.
In reports and other long-form content, a limit of 6 sentences in a paragraph is
acceptable.
If your paragraphs or sentences are too long, you might be trying to say too much in one
place.
Consider starting a new paragraph or using an itemised list (/node/56). Make sure the items
relate to each other and are grammatically parallel.
Digital Service Standard requirements
Use responsive design methods to make sure users can read the content on any
device. Short paragraphs are critical in responsive design: Criterion 6. Consistent and
responsive design (https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/digital-service-
standard/digital-service-standard-criteria/6-consistent-and-responsive-design).
Many people do not use a desktop computer or printed material to access
government services and information. Test your content on a mobile device first.
Write clear sentences using fewer than
25 words
All sentences should use plain language (/node/204#write_plain_language_sentences). Even
in technical documents, keep sentences to fewer than 25 words. Long sentences often
cause long paragraphs.

In complex content, you might need to use a paragraph or more for each of these points.
Accessibility requirements
User needs:
I can read and understand text, even if the content includes unusual words and
shortened forms, or features languages other than English.
Fundamentals:
Write in plain language. This helps all users and is essential for some.
Avoid (or explain) unusual words, phrases, idioms and so on. Expand all
acronyms on their first use.
Avoid using double negatives.

Tables
Tables provide a structure for complex and detailed information. Design
accessible tables and organise data so itʼs easy for users to scan.
Use tables if they make content easier to
read
Use a table only if there isnʼt a simpler way to present your content, such as a list, paragraph
of text or diagram.
Use tables for exact values and information that is too detailed for the text.
Donʼt create a table for only one or 2 items. Report them in the body of the text instead.
Design tables to allow users to:
scan the information
find an exact value
compare values in different categories
understand how you have categorised the information.
Donʼt make tables with other tables inside them (known as ‘nestedʼtables).
Some people will look at tables before they read the text. For this reason, design tables so
they are self-explanatory. You must still refer to the table to in the body of the text. Place the
table immediately after the reference to it in the text.07/09/2024, 14:02 Tables | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/tables 1/10Accessibility requirements
User needs:
I can change the content without losing information or structure.
I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.
Fundamentals:
Tables can be made accessible for all users. The World Wide Web Consortium
has tips for setting up tables (https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/tips/).
You must give a table:
- a title (also called a caption (/node/49))
- row and column headings
- information (entries)
- a cross-reference in the text.
You may also need to add notes below the table to help users understand the
information and where it comes from.
Donʼt rely on colour as the only visual means of conveying information in tables.
Donʼt leave cells empty. Use ‘zeroʼ or ‘nilʼ or 'n/a' where there is no data. If it is
numeric data, use the numeric zero (0). Only use zero if that is the true value.
WCAG quick reference:
1.3.1 Info and relationships – level A
(https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#info-and-relationships)
1.4.1 Use of color – level A (https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#use-of-
color)
Print considerations
Publish long and detailed tables separately or in an appendix. 
Refer to the table in the text
Tables support the discussion in the text, not the other way around. It is essential to refer to
a table in the text.07/09/2024, 14:02 Tables | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/tables 2/10A single table on a webpage does not need a table number. If you use tables repeatedly,
number tables and include the table number when you refer to the table in the text.
When using a table:
Place the table close to where you mention it in the text and after the paragraph that
refers to it. In print, the table should be on the same or facing page.
Ensure that the table number referenced in the text matches the table number in the
title.
Donʼt repeat the whole title of the table in the text.
Donʼt refer to ‘the table belowʼ or ‘the table aboveʼ.
Ensure that the information in the text is consistent with the information in the table.
Your text comments on or interprets the table. Where possible, avoid repeating the text or
data in the table word for word.
Print considerations
Avoid referring to a page number in the text. Page numbers can change during the
publishing process.
Limit tables to only the information the
user needs
Be informative, but donʼt include too much information. Use only as much text or data as you
need to make sure the table is easy to understand. Make sure information is:Write
Table 2 shows that average rainfall has …
Donʼt write
Table 2 (Average monthly rainfall, June 2017 to December 2019) shows that average
rainfall has …07/09/2024, 14:02 Tables | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/tables 3/10precise
relevant to the title or caption
from a credible source and backed by evidence
consistent with how itʼs presented in the text.
Check text and data in the table against the same information in the body of your content. It
is easy to make a last-minute change to one and forget to correct the other.
Place data in a consistent and sequential
order
Ensure that information in the table is correctly grouped and sits under the correct headings.
The text or data in a table should use the same grammatical form (for example, noun
(/node/122), noun phrase (/node/144) or sentence (/node/204)).
Organise data in a sequential order. For example, order a list of names alphabetically by
family name.
Merged cells can reduce usability for many people, including screen reader users. They can
be made accessible in HTML and PDF. Avoid using them in word processing applications.
To design usable tables:
Donʼt make tables too long or too wide.
Consider splitting a large, complex table into smaller tables.
If the content includes a large number of tables, consider putting them in an appendix.
Check the structure and content of all the tables in your content. If you repeat or
duplicate information, combine or delete tables.
Set column and row headings that are
clear and accurate
Use simple language in row and column headings for tables. This makes it easier for people
to understand the information. It also helps screen reader users navigate tables.
Structure tables so:07/09/2024, 14:02 Tables | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/tables 4/10the first row contains the column headings
the first column (also known as the ‘stubʼ) contains the row headings.
The column and row headings must relate to each other so users can make sense of the
information.
Mark up tables to show header cells and data cells. PDF software and web authoring
programs have tools to help you with this.
Use the same grammatical form for each entry in a column.
Complex tables
Complex tables have header cells that span more than one column or row. If you use a
complex table, you must define the column and row groups and mark up the table
accordingly. This is so screen reader users can access the information in the table.

(https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/irregular/)ʼ
Adobeʼs PDF accessibility repair: examine and repair tables
(https://www.adobe.com/accessibility/products/acrobat/pdf-repair-repair-tables.html).
Print considerations
If a table runs over pages when printed, ensure:
column headings appear at the top of each page
you repeat row headings on each page.
Add notes to provide sources or help
interpret the data
The notes below a table can apply to the whole table or a specific entry in the table.
Use notes to tell users:07/09/2024, 14:02 Tables | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/tables 5/10how to interpret information in the table
what the source of the information in the table is.
Donʼt include this information in the table title or caption or in ordinary footnotes or
endnotes.
To connect the note under the table to the information it refers to in the table use:
a symbol such as an asterisk (*) or hash (#) for only one note
superscript numbers or letters for more than one note.
Use only one type of note in a table. Either use all symbols, all superscript numbers or all
superscript letters.
When writing table notes, list them in the following order:
 . abbreviations
 . notes to superscript locators
 . general note to the table
 . source of data (use the appropriate form for author–date (/node/165) or documentary–
note (/node/166)).
Align notes to the left. They should not extend beyond the edges of the table. Donʼt use
superscript for the note identifiers (the symbol, number or letter) in the note. They should be
the same font size as the text of the notes so that they are easily found.
Copyright requirements
You must attribute copyright material (/node/181) you reference. This includes data
tables.
Read the government copyright rules in the Australian Government intellectual
property manual (https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/media-
centre/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).07/09/2024, 14:02 Tables | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/tables 6/10Scan-read table data and text for
alignment
The text and data in a table are as important as the structure. Align data and text so the table
is easy to scan.
In general:
Align text to the left.
Align numbers to the right.
In addition, decimal points in the column should line up.
Text should be set horizontally so it is easy to read. Donʼt rotate text to display vertically.
If you can, use a fixed-width font for numbers in columns to help users scan the column and
compare the values.
For column and row headings:
Align column headings with the content in the column.
Include the unit in the heading if it is not in the title or caption.
Left-align row headings.
Print considerations
Choose a clear typeface in a smaller point size than the text.
Donʼt use a point size that is too small. Although typefaces and sizes vary, anything
smaller than 8 points is too small.
Try to keep tables on one page. If you must use a long table:
omit the rule at the bottom of the table – this is a visual cue that the table is not
complete
at the bottom of the table, insert ‘(continued)ʼ aligned right to the edge of the
table
on the next page, repeat the caption and insert ‘(continued)ʼ after the table
number – for example, ‘Table 3 (continued): Farm output from 1990 to 2000ʼ.07/09/2024, 14:02 Tables | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/tables 7/10Use lines and contrast to help readability
Design tables for readability.
Donʼt use colour as the only way to convey meaning. 
Donʼt use cell or text formatting to convey meaning. It can make the table difficult to
read. Screen reader users cannot ‘seeʼ the formatting.
Use lines where they help people read the table. Short tables need only a line above
and below the header row and at the bottom of the table. Longer tables need lines, or
shading of alternate rows (zebra shading), to help people follow the alignment across
the table.
Ensure there is not too much white space between columns. This makes the content
harder to read.
A table will take up the full width of the screen when viewed on a mobile phone. This
may change the white space between columns and make it more or less readable.
A key benefit of tables is that they help people compare information. This is possible only if
tables look the same as one another. Use the same font, and font sizes, rule (line)
thicknesses and colour schemes for tables throughout the document.
Provide a summary for complex tables
For complex tables, provide a summary to give people who use screen readers an overview
of the information in the table.
The summary does not provide the same information as the title or caption.
Examples of summaries and captions and how to include them in HTML are in W3Cʼs caption
and summary tutorial (https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/caption-summary/).
A summary can include a brief description of what:
is in the rows and columns
is being measured and the units of measurements
the relationship between rows and columns is.07/09/2024, 14:02 Tables | Style Manual

Text boxes and callouts
Text boxes, pull-quotes and sidebars draw attention from body text. Make sure
they are accessible to everyone.
Limit the use of text boxes and callouts 
You can draw attention to information in content by using text boxes and callouts (pull-
quotes and sidebars). 
Before you include a text box or callout in your content, consider how it will help people
understand or use the information.
Donʼt overuse text boxes or callouts: they become a distraction. Avoid putting content in a
text box or callout just because you canʼt make it fit into the flow of the text.
Text boxes
Text boxes sit close to the text they support.
Text boxes should contain a summary, examples or an expansion of ideas in the body of the
text. This is because people:
scan text boxes before they read the body text
often read text boxes separately from the main body of the text.
Use text boxes to set information apart from the content. You can use text boxes for
information that is useful but not part of the main content, for example:

definitions.
Pull-quotes
Pull-quotes are a type of callout. They are often in the form of an incomplete quote and are
set apart with distinct formatting. They are not the same as ‘block quotations
(/node/114#format_long_quotes_as_block_quotes_with_no_quotation_marks)ʼ.
Pull-quotes are a device to draw the user back into the content.
Sidebars
Sidebars are a type of callout. They sit beside the main content and are more common in
print publications.
Use text boxes for supporting content,
not main text
Text boxes do more than highlight information. They also make it clear that it shouldnʼt be
read as part of the main text.
Use the same presentation for the same type of content. For example, present example text
boxes consistently, but differently to summary information.
Use the same rules for capitalisation, punctuation and lists as other text.Example
‘engaging with the user is vital in government contentʼ07/09/2024, 14:02 Text boxes and callouts | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/text-boxes-and-callouts 2/6Longer text boxes should have a heading or title to show people the purpose of the text box
at a glance. Make it distinct from the other headings in the text so you donʼt interrupt
the heading hierarchy (/node/51#organise_heading_levels_in_a_logical_order).
In technical or long-form content, text boxes often contain short articles that support the
main body of the text. Examples include case studies and descriptions of processes. They
often contain images (/node/46).
Number text boxes if they feature repeatedly in content. Refer to numbered text boxes in the
body text. You can use an appropriate identifier, such as ‘Box 1ʼ or ‘Case study 1ʼ.
Make text boxes accessible in HTML
Make sure boxes are readable by all users and on all devices.
For text boxes in HTML, use the <aside> element.
You can also use the <role=“complementary”> attribute to define an ARIA complementary
landmark. Use this when it sits outside the <main> content.
Alternatively, use the <role=“region”> attribute and assign a name if the content needs to sit
within the <main> section of a page.
For more information about formatting, visit the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C) ARIA landmarks example (https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-
practices/examples/landmarks/complementary.html).
Accessibility requirements
User needs:
I can change the content's presentation without losing information or structure.
I can find and navigate the content and determine where I am on the webpage.
Fundamentals:
Organise content in a clear order using section headings.
Choose colours and fonts that are readable. The design must be able to work
well on mobile devices.

Donʼt use text boxes in Microsoft Office
documents
You should not use text boxes in Word and PowerPoint. They are not accessible for most
users of screen readers.
In Word, text boxes can sit above or below the ‘document layerʼ that contains the page text –
they are floating objects that can't carry a semantic structure. These features mean that not
everyone using a screen reader can:
read floating objects
understand how box text relates to page text
read the box text and page text in the correct order.
Instead of text boxes, use borders and paragraph styles to highlight content visually. If these
styles don't work for your content, there are other solutions.
A one-by-one table is an option. If your document has complex formatting, accessible PDF
(Portable Document Format) (https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/format-writing-and-
structure/content-formats/pdf-portable-document-
format#make_pdf_content_accessible_to_all_users) might be a better option.

Sequential structure
Sequential structure follows a clear order to make it easy for users to follow
step by step. It can suit instructions or a report of an event.
Use a sequential structure to explain
steps or a specific order
A sequential structure shows a process, a series of steps or an order of events.
Use a sequential structure for:
instructions – such as how-to guides, recipes and directions
step-by-step content formats – such as forms
reports of events – such as incident reports, histories and case studies.
This type of structure helps users understand how items in the sequence relate to each
other.
Use the right writing style. For example, instructions and transactions are more direct and
use the imperative (/node/128). Reports of events usually use the past tense of the verb
(/node/128).

(https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#section-headings)
Split processes into balanced steps
Dividing a process into a sequence of steps can be challenging. Create the right number of
steps.
Too few steps might mean you have left out important information or grouped too many
actions under one heading.
Too many steps might mean you have divided the process into steps so small they are
meaningless.
If the process is very complex, group steps into broader stages of the process.
The broad stages can fit into a higher-level sequential structure, or into topics using a
hierarchical structure (/node/79). This combination of structures can help users revisit a
topic.
If you use a combination of structures, design menu and link items based on how users find
their way through the content (/node/74#learn_how_users_search_for_information). Be
consistent in the language, style and design of headings at the same level across the
content.
For example, in a course registration process, a student might decide to choose a different
course session after entering their personal details. Start with the most important
information – the course selection – so people donʼt waste time trying to find it.
Example
Course options
 . Select the course
 . Select the session

 . Enter your name
 . Enter your contact details07/09/2024, 14:03 Sequential structure | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/types-structure/sequential-structure 3/5Write clear instructions users can follow
For instructional and transactional content, people want to know what they need to do. They
donʼt need long explanations of the process.
If an explanation is needed, consider:
how you can help people keep their focus
what the minimum amount of information is
whether a link would be more useful.
If users need a lot of extra information to do a task, you might have tried to include too much
in a single step. You need to break the task into smaller steps.

Types of structure (/structuring-content/types-structure)>Narrative structure
Narrative structure
Narrative structure can suit long-form content, like technical writing or
academic journals. Users expect a beginning, middle and end.
Use narrative structure for long-form
content
Narrative structure is common in reports, books and technical writing. It generally works
better for long-form content than it does for digital content in HTML. This structure is used
with some success in long-form blogs (/node/44).
Narrative structure starts with general statements about the topic. The middle explains or
discusses new ideas. The conclusion summarises the main ideas and makes
recommendations.
This structure can cause people to miss important ideas:
The main points are not easy to find.
People usually need to read from beginning to end to understand the context, even if
there is only one main thing they need from the content.
To help users, you can summarise the main findings in the introduction.
Write a beginning, middle and end
Narrative structure has:07/09/2024, 14:03 Narrative structure | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/types-structure/narrative-structure 1/3a beginning – the introduction
a middle – the arguments, discussions and explanations
an end – conclusion or recommendations.
Signpost each part with headings (/node/51).
Academic writing also uses this structure. It starts with an introduction, followed by the
methods, a discussion and conclusion.
An abstract summarises the article in many academic journals (/node/57). People tend to
read the abstract and the conclusion of a research paper first, before they decide if they
want to read the whole paper.

Author–date
The author–date system includes details for author and date in the text with a
full citation in a list of references. This system is suitable for most Australian
Government content.
Include author and date in text, and list
full details later
The author–date system uses:
in-text citations with the authorʼs name and the date of publication
an alphabetical reference list with the full information about the source.
People use the information from an in-text citation to find the corresponding reference in the
list.
The author–date system is useful when you have many sources to cite. Itʼs mostly used in
scientific writing and government reports, but you can use it for any type of writing. Itʼs more
accessible than the documentary–note system, as there are no superscript numbers or
symbols.
The referencing systems used by Harvard and the American Psychological Association (APA)
are examples of the author–date system. Itʼs also called the name–year system.07/09/2024, 14:03 Author–date | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date 1/34Copyright requirements
You must properly attribute copyright material you cite or reference. This includes
text, images, video and sounds.
Include all the details required by open access licences (read how to attribute Creative
Commons (https://creativecommons.org.au/learn/fact-sheets/attribution/)).
Read the government copyright rules in the Australian Government intellectual
property manual (https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/media-
centre/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).
In-text citations
An in-text citation gives the authorʼs name and the date of publication. You can put the
authorʼs name as part of a sentence, or it can go in parentheses with the date. Always
include the date in parentheses. Donʼt separate the name and date with a comma.
Most in-text citations have only the authorʼs family name (or authoring organisationʼs name)
and the year.
Use the shortened form of an organisationʼs name in the in-text citation. (In the reference
list, you can use the shortened form followed by the spelt-out form in parentheses.)
Two or more authors
For a work by 2 authors, include both names in the in-text citation.Example
Jones (2017) reported similar results.
Other results were similar (Jones 2017).
Example
The ABC (2019) reported ...
Example
Black and Jones (2017) reported similar results.07/09/2024, 14:03 Author–date | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date 2/34For a work by 3 or more authors, use the first authorʼs name plus the Latin term ‘et al.ʼ
(meaning ‘and othersʼ). Donʼt use italics for ‘et al.ʼ. All authorsʼ names are included in the
reference list.
Use the word ‘andʼ between names outside and inside parentheses. Donʼt use the
ampersand (‘&ʼ).
Page numbers
Include page numbers in the in-text citation only when the work has page numbers and
youʼre including a direct quotation. Use a colon between the date and page numbers.
Multiple works in one citationExample
Holmes et al. (2019) reported many changes.
Write this
Other researchers reported similar results (Watson et al. 2017).
Not this
Other researchers reported similar results (Watson, Black, Jones and Abaza 2017).

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date 3/34When citing multiple works in the same in-text citation, use semicolons between citations.
Enclose all the citations in one set of parentheses.
Multiple works by the same author in the same year
When citing multiple works by the same author in the same year, put a letter after the date of
each citation. Put an ‘aʼ after the date of the first work you cite, then a ‘bʼ after the date of
the second, and so on.
Shortened forms and abbreviations of names
Use shortened forms and abbreviations in in-text citations to save space.
Use the same shortened form in the reference list, followed by the spelt-out version. That
way the user can easily find the reference but can also see the organisationʼs full name.
No date of publication
For works without a date, write ‘n.d.ʼ (for ‘no dateʼ) instead of the year of publication.Example
Other researchers reported similar results (White and Jones 2017; Black 2018; Abaza
2019).

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date 4/34Reference lists
A reference list includes the full details of every cited work. Use the heading ‘Referencesʼ.
On a webpage, place the reference list immediately after the content and under the heading
‘Referencesʼ. In print, place the reference list after any appendices but before an index.
If the content has sections written by different authors or on different subjects, include a
reference list at the end of each section. This helps users who are interested in only one
section and keeps reference lists manageable.
Include a reference in your list for each source you cite in text. All other sources can go in a
list called ‘More readingʼ or ‘More informationʼ. This list should appear after the reference list.
Some types of specialised sources, such as works of art, need their own reference list.
Others, like legislation, are only included in a reference list if there are references to other
types of works as well.
Check each type of specialised source that youʼre using to see if you need to include it in a
reference list.
Order the elements of each item in a
reference list
References in the list will have different elements depending on the type of source. For
example, when citing a book, include the name of the publisher. When citing a website,
include the date you accessed it.
The general order is:
 . author or authoring organisationʼs name
 . publishing date
 . title (and series or issue details)
 . publisher detailsWhite and Jones (n.d.) reported similar results.
Other researchers reported similar results (White and Jones n.d.).07/09/2024, 14:03 Author–date | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date 5/34 . accessed date (for digital content).
Some elements have shortened forms used in referencing. Use the shortened form when
appropriate.
Follow the examples of author–date citations.
Personal author names
Write the family name of the authors, editors or translators before writing their initials. Use
the original spelling for all author names.
Donʼt separate the family name from the initials with a comma. Donʼt separate initials with
full stops.
Works by 2 or more authors
Unlike for in-text citations, include all of the authorsʼ names in a reference list.Like this

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date 6/34Government names that have changed
Organisations change names over time. Use the name that appears on the source.
For example, the Services Australia annual report for 2016–17 has the author as the
Department of Human Services. That was the name of the agency at the time, so use
Department of Human Services as the author when you cite the report.
Shortened forms and abbreviations of organisationsʼ names
If you have used the shortened form of an organisationʼs name in your content, use it in your
references. Use the shortened form followed by the spelt-out version in parentheses.
Use the shortened form in subsequent references.
Only use a shortened form of an agencyʼs name if the agency uses it regularly.
For example, the Australian Public Service Commission regularly uses the initialism ‘APSCʼ,
so use it after the first mention and in the references.
Often, an organisation's name is both theauthor of the webpage and the name of the
website. To avoid repetition of long names, use the shortened form for the name of the
website after the title. Do this even if you have not introduced the shortened form before.Example

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date 9/34Hyperlink titles and include access dates
for online works
Unless the source is behind a paywall, hyperlink the title of works available online.
You donʼt need to include the URL in references in digital content.
Content publishers should make sure the CSS print style sheet
(https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss) automatically displays the URLs from the
hyperlinks when the content is printed. This might be a default style in your documentʼs
template.
If the document is print only, include a URL after the reference. Put the URL after the final full
stop.
Include the date you accessed the work. This is important because online sources can
change. The information youʼre linking to could be different to what users will find in the
future.
PDFs
If youʼre citing a PDF, avoid linking directly to the PDF. Instead link to the landing page where
the PDF is hosted.Example
DFAT (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade) (2018) Fact sheets for countries and
regions – India (https://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/resources/trade-and-economic-fact-
sheets-for-countries-economies-and-regions), DFAT, accessed 9 July 2021.

[A print-only reference: the full hyperlink comes after the full stop, as the title cannot be
hyperlinked.]07/09/2024, 14:03 Author–date | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date 10/34Landing pages tend to be a more stable place to link to. PDFs are often renamed or moved
around a site. Linking to a PDF also requires the user to download content.
If the PDF doesnʼt have a landing page, link to the PDF and include ‘PDFʼ in square brackets
after the title. Follow ‘PDFʼ with the file size in kilobytes (KB) or megabytes (MB). Include
both of these additional details in the linked text.
Cite the PDF with the details you can find in the document. Sometimes details like
publication dates will be missing.
Digital object identifiers (DOIs)
A DOI is a series of numbers and punctuation that identifies a document. Unlike a URL, a DOI
always stays the same. DOIs are also internationally standardised
(https://www.doi.org/index.html).
Works that have DOIs include most journal articles, some e-books and some PDFs.
If the document has a DOI, include it in the citation in the reference list. Put it at the end of
the citation and include the shortened form ‘doiʼ in lower case before it.Example
Thomson Reuters Australia (2017) ‘Legislation and commentary table of abbreviations
(https://support.thomsonreuters.com.au/product/westlaw-au/articles/westlaw-au-guide-

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date 11/34Detail page, volume and issue numbers
If a citation has a volume number, an issue number and page numbers, follow the format:
volume(issue):page–page.
In this example, the work is from volume 2, issue 4, and itʼs on pages 223 to 240.
Alphabetise the reference items in the
list
Order the reference list in alphabetical order, according to the family name and given name
of the lead author.
Multiple works by the same author
If you have multiple works by the same writer, list them in date order.Example

many times.
To avoid repetition, you can use 2 unspaced em dashes for works by the same author cited
immediately afterwards.
Multiple works by the same author in the same year
When citing multiple works by the same author in the same year, put a letter after the date of
each citation. Put an ‘aʼ after the date of the first work you cite and a ‘bʼ after the date of the
second one, and so on.
Include both works in the reference list.Schade S (11 February 2018) ‘Inverted pyramid: writing for comprehension

this advice exactly, but add a full stop at the end of the citation.
Sequence the elements of online sources
Only cite an entire website if you cannot pinpoint the material to a specific webpage or
webpage content.
For example, you might mention a website as a general resource in the body text. You would
give users the full details and link to that website in the reference list.
However, if you refer to content only found on a particular webpage on the website, you need
to pinpoint the relevant webpage or webpage content in the reference list.
Entire website
Hyperlink the name of the website. 
Always include the date you accessed the site at the end of the reference.
Use the same capitalisation as the organisation uses for the name of a website.
Include the word ‘websiteʼ after the name of the website in square brackets, unless you
include the URL for the homepage.
It is optional to include the URL for the homepage – for example ‘stylemanual.gov.auʼ. If you
include the homepage URL, do not include the word ‘websiteʼ in square brackets.Example

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date 31/34For translated works, use the original authorʼs name in the in-text citation.
Place of publication of a book
Only include the place of publication if itʼs relevant to the user.
The place of publication may be relevant if:
youʼre citing works with editions published in multiple locations
the location the book was published impacts the credibility of your work.
Editions of books published in different locations may have different spelling conventions.
For example, the same publisher may publish an edition in London (using UK spelling) and an
edition in New York (using US spelling).
Sometimes knowing the place of publication of the sources adds credibility to the work. For
example, an Australian publication may be more credible if it cites books published in
Australia. Including the publishing location clearly shows users where the book is from.
If the place of publication doesnʼt add useful information for the user, you can omit it from
your citation.
Dictionaries and encyclopedias
For dictionaries and encyclopedias, only include an in-text citation. Donʼt include a citation in

Home (/)>Referencing and attribution (/referencing-and-attribution)>Documentary–note
Documentary–note
The documentary–note system uses a symbol or number in the text to mark
detailed references in footnotes or endnotes. Choose this system only if it best
suits the mode of publishing content and user needs.
Place a reference marker in text, link it
to details in a note
The documentary–note system uses:
superscript reference markers – numbers or symbols – in the text
footnotes or endnotes with the full information about the source.
Each note has the corresponding superscript reference marker before it. Users find the note
by matching the number or symbol. In digital content, the reference markers can be
hyperlinked to help users access the note.
Accessibility requirements
Reference markers and footnotes can be inaccessible to:Example

23(4):1–12. [The corresponding note]1

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/documentary-note 1/34people who have low vision
people who use screen readers to access content
users of mobile phones.
If using reference markers and footnotes, ensure they:
are sized for easier readability
will display correctly on mobile phones or other small screen devices
can be made larger by users without loss of content or functionality
can be read by screen readers.
Seek specialist advice to ensure you achieve this functionality.
You can also increase accessibility by using the author–date system (/node/165),
which places references within the main text and uses fewer symbols.
Use notes for the sources you cite in the text. All other sources can be listed in a section
called ‘More readingʼ or ‘More informationʼ. This list should appear at the end of a page of
digital content, or at the end of a section in print.
Copyright requirements
You must attribute copyright material you reference. This includes text, images, video
and sounds.
Include all the details required by open access licences (read how to attribute Creative
Commons (https://creativecommons.org.au/learn/fact-sheets/attribution/)).
Read the government copyright rules in the Australian Government intellectual
property manual (https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/media-
centre/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).
Footnotes and endnotes
Footnotes are at the end of a page. Endnotes are at the end of a section, chapter or
document.
Use the heading ‘Notesʼ for footnotes in digital content and for endnotes. Donʼt use a
heading for footnotes in print-only publications.07/09/2024, 14:03 Documentary–note | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/documentary-note 2/34Footnotes
Footnotes are preferable for digital content, which has no set page length. The user can find
the source information on the page theyʼre accessing.
In print, footnotes work well if you only have a few citations. If you have many citations, the
footnote section at the bottom of the page can become quite long. This leaves you with little
space on the page for content.
Endnotes
Endnotes work better for print, which has a set page length, because they donʼt take up
space on a page.
In print, if you have sections written by different authors or on different subjects, include a
list of endnotes at the end of each section. This helps users who are only interested in one
section and keeps lists of notes manageable.
Use numbers for reference markers in
most content
Use reference numbers instead of symbols in most content. Numbers are easier for users to
match and theyʼre in an intuitive sequence.
In content that uses a lot of citations, restart numbering on each page of digital content or in
each section of a document.
Symbols
Reference symbols are best for content with many numbers, such as content with
mathematical equations.
Use symbols if thereʼs a risk that users will confuse superscript numbers for exponents.
Like this
2x2 − 2x + 12 = 16*
Not this07/09/2024, 14:03 Documentary–note | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/documentary-note 3/34Reference symbols can be especially difficult for screen readers to read or link to.
Symbols can affect readability unless a user changes default settings (verbosity settings).
By default, screen readers wonʼt necessarily read the symbols by their names – for example,
‘asteriskʼ can be announced as ‘starʼ. This can affect peopleʼs ability to quickly understand
the reference markers.
If this will be an issue for your users, especially in digital content, use the author–date
system instead.
Footnotes and symbols
If you use symbols, use footnotes instead of endnotes. Itʼs easier for users to match symbols
if theyʼre closer together.
Order of reference symbols
Use the symbols in this order:
* (asterisk)
† (dagger)
‡ (double dagger)
§ (section sign)
# (hash sign).
Restart the symbols on each page. If you have more than five notes on a page, double the
symbols (**, ††).
Put reference markers in the right place
Putting reference markers in the right place helps users find references without interrupting
their reading.
In digital content, hyperlink the reference marker to help users access the note.2x2 − 2x + 12 = 16107/09/2024, 14:03 Documentary–note | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/documentary-note 4/34Reference markers for in-text citations
Place reference markers immediately after quoted material, or after phrases, clauses or
sentences. Donʼt interrupt a phrase or clause with a reference marker.
Place reference markers after commas and other sentence punctuation.
Reference markers for endnotes and footnotes
Place reference markers before the footnote or endnote. Add a single space between the
reference marker and the beginning of the reference.
More than one reference marker
Donʼt use more than one reference marker in the same place, such as when citing 2 works.
Instead cite both works in one footnote or endnote, separating the entries in the note with a
semicolon.Like this

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/documentary-note 5/34Order the elements of each reference in
a note
Format all notes consistently to help users find the source.
Elements in a note
Citations in notes will have different elements depending on the type of source. For example,
when citing a book, include the name of the publisher. When citing a website, include the
date you accessed it.
The general order is:
 . author or authoring organisationʼs name
 . title
 . publisher
 . publishing date
 . accessed date (for digital content).
If you cite the same work more than once, give it its own reference marker. In the notes, use
a shortened form of the citation after the first mention, instead of citing the full source again.
Short forms include only the authorʼs family name (or authoring organisation name) and the
title of the source.Like this

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/documentary-note 6/34If youʼre using endnotes at the end of each section, use the long form of the reference note
the first time you cite the work in that section.
Some elements have shortened forms used in referencing (/node/92). Use the shortened
form when appropriate.
Donʼt use the Latin abbreviations ‘ibid.ʼ, ‘op cit.ʼ or ‘loc cit.ʼ for repeated citations.
Follow the examples of documentary–note citations.
Personal author names
Write the initials of given names before writing the family name of the authors, editors or
translators. Use the original spelling for all author names.
Donʼt separate initials with full stops.
Short citations include only the authorʼs name and the title. Donʼt include initials in short
citations.
More than 2 authors
Shortened forms include up to 2 author family names. When you have more than 2 authors,
use the Latin term ‘et al.ʼ (meaning ‘and othersʼ) in short citations. Donʼt use italics for ‘et al.ʼ.Write this

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/documentary-note 7/34Organisation as author
If the author is an organisation, short citations use the shortened form of the organisationʼs
name.
The first note to cite the organisation as author gives the name in full, and introduces the
shortened form.
Government names that have changed
Organisations change names over time. Use the name that appears on the source.
For example, the Services Australia annual report for 2016–17 has the author as the
Department of Human Services. That was the name of the agency at the time, so use
Department of Human Services as the author when you cite the report.
Shortened forms and abbreviations of organisationsʼ names
If you have used the shortened form of an organisationʼs name in your content, use it in your
references. Use the shortened form followed by the spelt-out version in parentheses.
Use the shortened form in subsequent references.Example

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/documentary-note 8/34Only use a shortened form of an agencyʼs name if the agency uses it regularly.
For example, the Australian Public Service Commission regularly uses the initialism ‘APSCʼ,
so use it after the first mention and in the references.
Often, an organisation's name is both theauthor of the webpage and the name of the
website. To avoid repetition of long names, use the shortened form for the name of the
website after the title. Do this even if you have not introduced the shortened form before.
Style and spell titles consistently
Use capitals, italics and punctuation consistently in all cited titles.
Follow the rules in the examples of documentary–note citations:
Capitalise all proper nouns, the names of periodicals and the first word of the title or
type of work.
Use lower case for all other words.
Use commas to separate elements.
Use a full stop at the end of the reference.DFAT (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade), Fact sheets for countries and regions –

Digital object identifiers (DOIs)
A DOI is a series of numbers and punctuation that identifies a document. Unlike a URL, a DOI
stays the same always. DOIs are also internationally standardised
(https://www.doi.org/index.html).
Works that have DOIs include most journal articles, some e-books and some PDFs.Example

of the work.
Place of publication of a book
Only include the place of publication if itʼs relevant to the user.
The place of publication may be relevant if:
youʼre citing works with editions published in multiple locations
the location the book was published impacts the credibility of your work.
Editions of books published in different locations may have different spelling conventions.
For example, the same publisher may publish an edition in London (using UK spelling) and an
edition in New York (using US spelling).
Sometimes knowing the place of publication of the sources adds credibility to the work. For
example, an Australian publication may be more credible if it cites books published in
Australia. Including the publishing location clearly shows users where the book is from.
If the place of publication doesnʼt add useful information for the user, you can omit it from
your citation.
Dictionaries and encyclopaedias
For dictionaries and encyclopaedias, mention them in the text but donʼt include a note.F Backman and F Hall, A man called Ove: a novel (H Koch and K Zimmer trans),

Legal material
There are different conventions for how to cite legal material. Follow one style
consistently to help people read and use the information.
Cite legal material consistently and
accurately
Itʼs important to cite legal sources in a consistent and accurate way across government.
The Style Manual gives common guidance for different types of legal material, including:
bills and explanatory material (/node/207)
Acts of parliament (/node/208)
schedules (/node/209)
delegated legislation (/node/210)
cases and legal authorities (/node/211)
treaties (/node/212).
If your government agency has a legislative focus, you might need more detail. For example,
for an authoritative source for specific legal conventions, you might use the 4th edn of the
Australian guide to legal citation (https://law.unimelb.edu.au/mulr/aglc/about).
Use the Style Manual guidance to cite legal material for any type of content. If you work on
non-government material, follow the appropriate style for your publication.07/09/2024, 14:03 Legal material | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material 1/8Use the correct legislation title
Unless it is obvious from the context:
Put the title first when writing in-text citations, footnotes and endnotes.
Follow the title with the rest of the citation.
Use the following databases to find the authorised titles of legislation from each Australian
jurisdiction.
Commonwealth
Federal Register of Legislation (https://www.legislation.gov.au/)
States and territories
ACT Legislation Register (https://www.legislation.act.gov.au/)
NSW legislation (https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/)
Northern Territory legislation (https://legislation.nt.gov.au/)
Queensland legislation (https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/)
South Australian legislation (https://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/index.aspx)
Tasmanian legislation (https://www.legislation.tas.gov.au/)
Victorian legislation and parliamentary documents (http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/)
Western Australian legislation (https://www.legislation.wa.gov.au/)Write this
The Loans Security Act 1973 (subsection 5A(b)) provides for ...
Commonwealth legislation (Loans Security Act 1973,subsection 5A(b)) provides for ...
[The citation pinpoints subsection 5A(b) of the Act after giving its title.]
Not this
Commonwealth legislation (subsection 5A(b), Loans Security Act 1973) provides for ...07/09/2024, 14:03 Legal material | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material 2/8Current (in force) or amending legislation
When you search or browse databases – such as the databases in the lists above – look for
legislation that is ‘consolidatedʼ or ‘in forceʼ. This is current law. Consolidated legislation
includes all amendments made by other laws since the legislation was first enacted. It is
sometimes called the ‘principal legislationʼ.
Amending legislation changes existing law. In legal databases, the version that was originally
enacted (not including later amendments) is called ‘as madeʼ, ‘as passedʼ or, for Acts, ‘as
enactedʼ.
The work of government has its basis in legislation. When you write about a particular policy,
service or program, you often need to refer to recent changes to the relevant law (amending
legislation). You will also name the legislation that currently applies (consolidated
legislation). You might have to write about changes in the law over time. In this case, you
would mention amending legislation that is no longer in force.
The text of consolidated legislation includes information to show how it has been amended
over time. Look in the endnotes named ‘Legislation historyʼ and ‘Amendment historyʼ to find
this information.
A useful way to track the history of legislation, particularly for historical material not
published online is to use The Office of Parliamentary Counsel (OPC) Legislation tables
(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Content/LegislationTables).
Add detail to citations with notes
Writing about the law and legal matters requires careful citation.
You can use in-text citations and footnotes or endnotes (notes) to provide accurate and
complete details.
In-text citations
For general content, in-text citations often give people all the information they need.
Example
The Major Bank Levy Act 2017imposes a levy on authorised deposit-taking institutions.07/09/2024, 14:03 Legal material | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material 3/8Notes
Always list the legislation or case name first in a basic note.
Explanatory notes might vary. They can be a useful way to add extra information that would
otherwise clutter the content.
Each note has the corresponding superscript reference marker before it. Users find the note
by matching the number.
In digital content, the reference markers can be hyperlinked to help users access the note.
Use hyperlinked endnotes in digital content. 
Accessibility requirements
Reference markers and endnotes can be inaccessible to:
people who have low vision
people who use screen readers to access content
users of mobile phones.In South Australia v Commonwealth (First Uniform Tax Case), Chief Justice Latham of
the Federal Court ...
Example
The levy threshold is indexed quarterly. [A superscript reference marker for the first
note]
The legislative basis for parliamentary remuneration and entitlements is complex. [A
superscript reference marker for the second note]
Major Bank Levy Act 2017, subsection 4(3). [A basic note corresponding to the first
reference marker]
 Section 48 of the Australian Constitution provides for the payment of members of
parliament. Commonwealth Acts include Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990,
Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973, Ministers of State Act 1952, ... other Acts and
associated delegated legislation. [An explanatory note corresponding to the second
reference marker]1

207/09/2024, 14:03 Legal material | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material 4/8If using reference markers and endnotes, ensure they:
are sized for easier readability
will display correctly on mobile phones or other small screen devices
can be made larger by users without loss of content or functionality
can be read by screen readers.
Seek specialist advice to ensure you achieve this functionality.
Print considerations
In print, follow your organisationʼs style preference for footnotes or endnotes. Choose
the style that people will find most useful.
Include separate reference lists for legal
material in 3 situations
Certain government agencies and specialist legal publications will use a reference list.
Most government writers should only include a reference list if one of these applies:
People need the list to understand the content.
The content includes a reference list for non-legal sources.
It is agency style to have a reference list.
Set up separate lists under the subheadings ‘Legislationʼ and ‘Legal casesʼ. Arrange
legislation and legal cases in alphabetical order under these headings.
Write the titles of Acts and legal cases in roman type, even though theyʼre italicised in the
text. Blocks of italics are difficult to read.
Example
[Reference list headings separate legislation from cases]

Shortened forms used in referencing
Shortened forms used in
referencing
Shortened forms are used in referencing to help people quickly identify
sources. Unlike other shortened forms, some Latin shortened forms retain full
stops.
Use roman type, not italics
In referencing, present shortened forms in roman type (not italics). Always start them with a
lower case letter, even when they are derived from Latin words.
Only some Latin shortened forms and ‘n.d.ʼ take full stops.

Avoid Latin shortened forms in
referencing systems
The terms ‘ibid.ʼ, ‘op. cit.ʼ, ‘loc. cit.ʼ and ‘id.ʼ are sometimes used in the documentary–note
system and other styles of referencing.
This is no longer common usage. These terms should be avoided unless they are required by
a publisher.
The term ‘ibid.ʼ refers users to the same publication that was cited immediately before it. It
can refer to the same page or to a different one.
Example
 . R Hyslop, Aye aye, Minister, AGPS Press, Canberra, 1990, p 89.07/09/2024, 14:04 Shortened forms used in referencing | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/shortened-forms-used-referencing 3/6The term ‘op. cit.ʼ refers users back to information from different pages in the same
publication. The difference between ‘ibid.ʼ and ‘op. cit.ʼ is that there can be several
references between the first mention of the publication and later mentions.
The term ‘loc. cit.ʼ refers the reader back to the same page of a publication already cited.
The term ‘id.ʼ signifies that the work in the second note is by the same author as the work in
the first note. . ibid.
 . ibid., p 160.
[These 3 references all cite the same publication (Hyslopʼs Aye aye, Minister). The third
reference cites a different page number.]
Example
 . R Hyslop, Aye aye, Minister, AGPS Press, Canberra, 1990, p 89.
 . ... [works by other authors]
 . R Hyslop, op. cit., p 171.
[Two of the references use information from different pages in the same publication
(Hyslopʼs Aye aye, Minister, pages 89 and 171).]

 . R Hyslop, Aye aye, Minister, AGPS Press, Canberra, 1990, p 89.

Broadcast media and podcasts (film, video, television and radio programs)
Broadcast media and podcasts (film,
video, television and radio
programs)
Cite film, television, radio and podcast programs so people can find the source
material. Use the right style and comply with copyright laws.
Cite electronic media correctly
Electronic media include film, television, radio and podcasts. When you write about
electronic media you could also be referring to a script or a review.
Many of the general naming rules apply:
Use sentence case – retain initial capitals for the first word, proper nouns and proper
adjectives.
Use italics for published works and roman type for unpublished works.
Use roman type and quotation marks for parts of works, such as episodes.
Use roman type and the spelling and capitalisation that the company uses for the
names of channels, streaming services and networks.
Use full names of organisations the first time you mention them.
Italicise the titles of films, television and radio programs, and podcasts.
Place the names of episodes in quotation marks and roman type.07/09/2024, 14:04 Broadcast media and podcasts (ﬁlm, video, television and radio programs) | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/broadcast-media-and-podcasts-ﬁlm-video-television-and-radio-programs 1/10Examples of in-text citations and reference lists on this page follow the author–date system,
as this is the most common way of citing film, television and radio programs in government
content.
Copyright requirements
You must attribute copyright material you reference. This includes video and audio.
Include all the details required by open access licences (read how to attribute Creative
Commons (https://creativecommons.org.au/learn/fact-sheets/attribution/)).
Read the government copyright rules in the Australian Government intellectual
property manual (https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/media-
centre/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).
Use italics and sentence case for film
titles
Write the title as it appears in film information. Include punctuation marks and any intentional
misspelling. Italicise the title and use sentence case.
If the film is part of a series, include the number of the series in the same format as in the
original title of the film. For example, if the original title has the number written as a word,
use the word.
In-text citations of films often include the year of production. Place this after the title in
roman type and enclosed in parentheses.
If you mention the date in the text, you donʼt have to include it in parentheses.
Example
Ride like a girl (2019) tells the story of jockey Michelle Payne.
Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) helped to revive the Australian film industry in the 1970s.
Mad Max 2 (1981) was the second in the Mad Max series of films.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/broadcast-media-and-podcasts-ﬁlm-video-television-and-radio-programs 2/10After the first mention, you can abbreviate the title as long as it makes sense. You can also
omit the date in parentheses. This often happens with well-known and longer titles because
it improves the flow of the text.
Reference list entries for films
In a reference list, use the director and the year of release. Include the place of production if
known. If there is no credited director, use the name of the producer.
Rule: Director D (director) or Producer P (producer) (Year) Title of film: subtitle of film
[motion picture], Name of Studio or Publisher, Place of Production.
Italicise television programs
Use sentence case, roman type and quotation marks for episodes of a program.
Use roman type and no quotation marks for the names of:
production companies
networks
channels
streaming services.Example
Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) continues to be a popular film. Joan Lindsay wrote the
story that formed the basis for Picnic.

Author–date (/referencing-and-attribution/author-date)>Classics
Classics
Classics are works from ancient and medieval times. Cite titles in line with the
author–date system. Use correct attribution to help people find the source in its
original language or as an English translation.
Cite classics as book titles
Disciplines and sources define the term ‘classicsʼ in different ways. This guidance covers
ancient Greek and Roman works (until the 5th century) and works from the medieval period
(from the fall of the Roman empire until the middle of the 15th century).
In references and in-text citations, treat the titles of classics as you would other book titles.
Use sentence case – capitalise only the first letter of the title and the first letter of any
proper noun.
Use italics for the titles of books, series and anthologies.
Use quotation marks for the titles of chapters, poems or sections.
If youʼre using a reference list, include any classics that you cite.
Examples of in-text citations and reference lists on this page follow the author–date system,
as this is the most common way of citing the classics in government content. If your
organisation uses the documentary–note system, change the citation and style of reference
list accordingly.07/09/2024, 14:04 Classics | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/classics 1/8Use correct in-text citations
Often there will not be much information for classics. For example, you might not know the
date of publication.
Include the information that you know in in-text citations.
If you donʼt know the name of the author, donʼt use ‘Anonʼ, ‘unknownʼ or ‘Anonymousʼ in the
in-text citation.
If you donʼt know the author or the date of a work, use the name of the translator (trans) and
the date of publication of the edition youʼre working with. Place the date at the end of the
reference.
Use common names for authors
Most authors of the classical and medieval periods are known just by a common name,
rather than a given name and a surname.
Use the authorʼs common name in text, in-text citations and reference lists.
As with other books, if you mention the author in the sentence, donʼt place the authorʼs
name in brackets with the title of the work.Like this
Beowulf is the story of a hero who defeats a dragon.
Like Grendel (Beowulf), you seem to suffer with the joy of others.
Not this
Beowulf (Anon) is the story of a hero who defeats a dragon.
Like Grendel (Anonymous Beowulf), you seem to suffer with the joy of others.
Example
Beowulf(Heaney S, trans), Faber & Faber Ltd, London, 2002. [Reference-list entry]07/09/2024, 14:04 Classics | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/classics 2/8Include divisions in in-text citations
when possible
Some classics have divisions. Divisions organise prose and poetry into, for example, books,
chapters, sections, lines and verses.
In the examples above:
‘65C–66Eʼ are section numbers
‘3.810ʼ means book 3, line 810
‘20.151ʼ means canto 20, line 151.Write this
As Cicero expressed it, ‘Is there anything rasher and more unworthy of the dignity and
strength of character of a wise man than the holding of a false opinion?ʼ (On the nature
of the gods)
Not this
As Marcus Tullius Cicero expressed it, ‘Is there anything rasher and more unworthy of
the dignity and strength of character of a wise man than the holding of a false opinion?ʼ
(On the nature of the gods)
Example
As one of the early philosophers wrote, ‘All wars are undertaken for the acquisition of
wealth.ʼ (Plato Phaedo65C–66E)
He ended his retirement speech with Ovidʼs ‘Turn loose the swans that drew my poetʼs
car.ʼ (The art of love3.810)
Josh hesitated at the doorway until, like Dante, he ‘went on, timid and full of thoughtʼ.
(Dante The divine comedy20.151) [In this example, Dante appears in the text as a
character in The divine comedy and appears in the citation as author]07/09/2024, 14:04 Classics | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/classics 3/8If the work youʼre citing has divisions, quote them in the in-text citation. The first time you
cite a work, spell out the divisions. Place a comma between the title of the work and the first
division. Separate divisions with a comma.
For subsequent citations, donʼt spell out the divisions. You only need the division numbers.
Separate divisions with a full stop. Donʼt place a comma between the title of the work and
the division numbers.
If you have only one division to cite, always spell it out. Place a comma between the title and
the division.
If youʼre referring to an edition that doesnʼt have divisions, you can refer to specific page
numbers. In these cases, place the date of the translation – or edition – youʼre working with
and the page number after the title of the work. Separate the date from the page numbers
with a colon, not a full stop. Donʼt use spaces around the colon.Example
(Ovid The art of love, book 3, line 810)
Josh hesitated at the doorway until, like Dante, he ‘went on, timid and full of thought.ʼ
(Dante The divine comedy, canto 20, line 151)
Example
(Ovid The art of love 3.815)
(Dante The divine comedy20.151)
Example
Virgil and Dante argue over the value of pitying the sinners in their suffering. (Dante The
divine comedy, canto 20)
Example
As one of the early philosophers wrote, ‘All wars are undertaken for the acquisition of
wealth.ʼ (Plato Phaedo1954 85)
Josh hesitated at the doorway until, like Dante, he ‘went on, timid and full of thought.ʼ
(The divine comedy1954 265)07/09/2024, 14:04 Classics | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/classics 4/8Cite titles in the most appropriate
language
Most of the time, youʼll be working with translations. The exception is when youʼre quoting
text in the original language.
Accessibility requirements
If any text should be pronounced in its original language (rather than English), screen
readers need to be able to determine what that language is.
WCAG quick reference: 3.1.2 Language of parts – level AA
(https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=312%2C131#language-
of-parts)
Translated works
In in-text citations, refer to the English title that appears on the source youʼre citing. If you
include the work in a reference list, use the date of the translation and the name of the
translator (‘transʼ).
Works in the original language
You will rarely need to cite works in the original language.
In these cases, cite the title in the original language. If the original language uses a different
alphabet to English – ancient Greek for example – use the anglicised spelling.Example
The heroism of women is a common motif in the stories of Hecuba, Andromache and
Cassandra. (Euripides The Trojan women) [In-text citation]
Euripides, The Trojan women (https://www.gutenberg.org/files/35171/35171-h/35171-
h.htm), (Murray G and Allen G, trans), London, 1905; Project Gutenberg, 2011, accessed
30 November 2019. [Reference-list entry: the date of the translation was 1905.]
Like this07/09/2024, 14:04 Classics | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/classics 5/8List classics with other references
You donʼt usually need a reference list for classics.
If you are using a reference list because youʼre citing other works as well, then include the
classics you have cited.
If you include a classics work in the reference list, cite the particular translation and edition
you are working with. Make sure you:
specify the date of the edition, not the date of the creation of the work
acknowledge the translator (‘transʼ)
place the date at the end of the reference list entry – this is contrary to author–date
style, but it stops possible confusion caused by, for example, ‘Plato (1954)ʼ
hyperlink titles in digital content where available.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/musical-compositions 4/9Catalogue numbers
Some composition names include the catalogue number.
‘Op.ʼ is the abbreviated form of the Latin ‘opusʼ, meaning ‘workʼ. It is a common catalogue
term for many composers' works. Always use a full stop with this abbreviation.
Some of the more prolific composers have a catalogue of their own. For example, ‘BWVʼ is
the shortened form of the German Bach Werke Verzeichnis. The English translation is ‘Bach
works catalogueʼ.
Never spell out these shortened forms.
Use italics for long works and
compilations, roman type for songs 
Style for the title of a composition depends on what version you are referring to.
Songs and short pieces
Place the titles of songs or short, discrete pieces in single quotation marks. Use sentence
case.
Composition titles can be the name that the composer or producer gave the work or they
can be a popular name. The titles of hymns follow the same style.Example
The town meeting ended with the school children singing ‘The road to Gundagaiʼ.
Justine Clarke became well known among Australian children for her 2005 song ‘I like to
singʼ.
Example
Many people know Beethovenʼs piano sonata no 14 ‘Quasi una fantasiaʼ as the
‘Moonlight sonataʼ.07/09/2024, 14:04 Musical compositions | Style Manual

title. Apply the capitalisation rules of the original language.
Use the abbreviation ‘ftʼ for artists named as featuring on song recordings.
Long works or series
Long works include operas, ballets and musicals. They may consist of a collection of shorter
pieces.
Use italics and sentence case for the titles of long works. If the title is in a language other
than English, refer to it in the original language. Apply the capitalisation rules of that
language.
Albums and compilations
Use italics and sentence case for the titles of albums, compilations, playlists and collections.
Use the same punctuation as the original title of the album or compilation.Example

Reference play titles and quotes from
plays
Style for play titles follows the same convention as for books but is based on details about
the published edition. Quoted material from plays has distinct punctuation and formatting.
Use italics and sentence case for titles of plays
Write titles of plays in italics and use sentence case. This means the first word and any
proper nouns have an initial capital letter.
Use a forward slash to show line breaks in plays
When you quote lines spoken by a character in a play, use a forward slash to show line
breaks appearing in the original. Insert spaces around the forward slash. If there's a line
break in your text, it can occur before or after the slash.
Donʼt use quotation marks in scripts of plays
In plays, you donʼt need quotation marks if the direct speech follows the name of the
speaker.Example
The theme of Williamsonʼs Emerald city is in stark contrast to that of The club.
Noni Hazlehurst played Kathy in the Sydney Theatre Companyʼs play No names … no
pack drill.
Example
Adita loved to quote Hamlet on days like this. ‘Tis now the very witching time of night /
When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out / Contagion to this world …ʼ Her
colleagues found these performances tiresome.07/09/2024, 14:04 Plays and poetry | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/plays-and-poetry 2/13Use divisions for in-text citations of plays
Citations to plays are more helpful if you use divisions – acts, scenes and lines. Readers who
wish to read the quote in context can use the divisions to find it in any edition of the play.
Use the full name of the playwright, unless people can identify the playwright by the
surname. Use roman type (not italics), lower case and numerals for divisions.
Ancient and medieval dramatic works have specific citation rules: refer to classics
(/node/172).
Include plays if youʼre using a reference list
In government content, you donʼt need to create a reference list just to cite plays. If you have
a reference list already, then add plays to your list. You can also add reviews of plays to the
list.
Citing plays
Use the edition of the play you cited. If the play was written well before the edition, place the
original date in parentheses with the editionʼs publishing date.
Rule: Author A (Year of Original Publication/Year of Edition) Title of play: subtitle of play,
Name of Publisher of Edition, Place of Publication.Example
RICHARDS: Youʼve the luck of the devil.
NED: Itʼs not luck; itʼs gumption. We donʼt think with our boots as traps do.

page number after a colon if youʼre citing a specific page. Use the original and edition dates
if citing an old work.
Citing reviews of plays
Follow the rules of citation for the source (for example, a newspaper) that published the
review. Use italics for the title of the play.
Rule: Reviewer R (Day Month Year) ‘Title of review: subtitle of reviewʼ [Review of Title of
work by Creator], Name of Blog, Newspaper or Magazine, accessed Day Month Year.
Reference poem titles and parts of
poems
Style for references to poem titles depends on how the poem was published. Refer to parts
of poems using the right kind of punctuation. Yeats WB (1892/2018) The Countess Cathleen: a play, CreateSpace Independent
Publishing Platform, Scotts Valley.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/plays-and-poetry 4/13Use quotation marks for titles of poems
Enclose titles of poems in quotation marks. If the title is part of a quotation, enclose it in
double quotation marks.
Italicise titles of poems published as books
Poems can be published as a freestanding work in book form. In this case, follow the citation
rules for books. Use italics for the poemʼs title.
This means you italicise the titles of verse novels as you do for prose novels.
Capitalise and punctuate the title of a poem as the author
does
A poemʼs title is part of its artistic integrity. Apply the authorʼs own style for capitalisation
and punctuation. If the title is all lower case or all upper case, follow suit.
If youʼre unsure of the authorʼs style, write the titles of poems using sentence case.
Sentence case can usually replace title case (maximal capitalisation), which is often a
publishing style rather than an artistic choice.Example

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/plays-and-poetry 5/13Italicise titles of filmpoems
Filmpoems are a combination of images and poetry (spoken or written) watched on a screen.
Filmpoems also include people reciting poetry onscreen. Sometimes filmpoems have other
names, such as ‘poetryfilmsʼ, ‘videopoemsʼ or ‘screen poetryʼ.
Italicise titles of filmpoems and use the original capitalisation and punctuation.
Use the first lines of untitled, published poems
Some poems do not have titles. They often become known by their first line and are usually
cited that way. Even if the poem isnʼt well known, use the first line as a title for untitled
poems. The aim is to give readers enough information to find the poem.
Use quotation marks as you would for other titles. Capitalise the line as it appears in the
poem.
Describe untitled, unpublished spoken word poems
The nature of spoken word and performance poetry means the text often isnʼt published.
Give people enough information to appreciate and identify the poem. Itʼs possible a
performance was recorded. To help people find it online, name the poet and the event, or
quote some of the poetʼs words.George Adeʼs poem ‘R-E-M-O-R-S-Eʼ begins with the lines, ‘The cocktail is a pleasant
drink, / Itʼs mild and harmless, I donʼt think.ʼ
Example
The videopoem Dog Daze is the work of Adelaide poet and former anatomy
professor Ian Gibbons.
Example
Birmingham included his sonnet ‘I am very bothered when I thinkʼ in the collection titled
Paper aeroplane: selected poems 1989–2014.
Arthur Buller wrote ‘There was a young lady from Brightʼ, a limerick about relativity.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/plays-and-poetry 6/13Use italics for titles of anthologies and other collections
If a poem is part of a published collection, italicise the title of the collection and use
sentence case. Use quotation marks for the poems in the collection.
Use a forward slash to show line breaks in poems
Separate lines of poetry in a sentence with a forward slash. Insert spaces around the forward
slash. If there's a line break in your text, it can occur before or after the slash.
Use in-text citations for quotations from poems
In government writing, mentioning the poet and the title of the poem is usually enough.
Always cite quotations in text. Follow the quotation with the poetʼs name in roman type and
the title of the poem in quotation marks. Use the poetʼs full name, unless people can identify
the poet by the surname alone.Arielle Cottinghamʼs performance at the 2016 Australian Poetry Slam began with the
words, ‘History is an oceanʼ.
Zaynab Farahʼs mother is at the centre of her poem, which explores the ‘whyʼ of
societyʼs response to difference. She performed it at the 2019 Australian Poetry Slam.
Example
‘(Because I am a daughter) of diasporaʼ appeared in Eunice Andradaʼs collection Flood

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/plays-and-poetry 7/13Use divisions if they are available
Use lower case and numerals for divisions.
Divisions are cantos, verses, stanzas and lines marked and numbered on the text of some
longer, older poems. Divisions are the same for all editions of these poems. This means that
people who want to read a quotation in context can use divisions to find the quotation in any
edition.
If a poem does not have divisions, use a reputable online version and hyperlink the poemʼs
title. Users can then search to find the cited lines on the webpage.
For subsequent citations, you can use just use the division numbers, without the words ‘partʼ,
‘verseʼ or ‘linesʼ.
Hyperlinked citations are an option for digital content.
Include poems if youʼre using a reference list
You donʼt need to create a separate reference list to cite poems, but if you have a reference
list already, then add poems to your list.
Use the edition of the poem you cited. If the poem was written well before the edition, place
the original date in parentheses with the editionʼs publishing date.The poet wrote ‘… There was enough space, enough / suddenness, as if everything
might stay in reach.ʼ (Martin Harrison ‘Tasmaniaʼ)
Example
Here are 2 of the most famous – and misquoted – lines in poetry. ‘Water, water, every
where, / Nor any drop to drink.ʼ (Coleridge The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, part 2, verse
29, lines 121–2).

As in text, use the original capitalisation of the poem in the reference list entry.
Use the author–date system for in-text citations in documents with a reference list. Include a
page number after a colon if youʼre citing a specific page. Use the original and edition dates
if citing an old work.Example

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/plays-and-poetry 9/13Cite Shakespeareʼs poetry correctly
William Shakespeare wrote 154 sonnets and other poetry. Sometimes people cite the songs
from Shakespearean plays as verse.
Each sonnet has a number (not a title). The number is a division number that remains the
same across editions. To cite the sonnets use either:
Sonnet X
the first line in quotation marks, as for other untitled poems.
Use italics for Venus and Adonis and The rape of Lucrece. They are available as freestanding
publications.
Use quotation marks for Shakespeareʼs other poetic works.
Treat nursery rhymes, fairy tales and
fables like books
If a nursery rhyme, fairy tale or fable is published individually as a book or dramatic work, use
italics for the title.
If they are part of a collection, use italics for the collection but quotation marks for individual
works. Treat individual works as you would a chapter in a book.Example
Shakespeareʼs Sonnet 116 contains lines often read during marriage ceremonies ‘… love
is not love / Which alters when it alteration finds, / Or bends with the remover to remove.ʼ
Shakespeareʼs ‘Let me not to the marriage of two mindsʼ is a popular reading at wedding
ceremonies.
Example
‘A loverʼs complaintʼ is Shakespeareʼs shortest narrative poem.
Portiaʼs musicians sing ‘Tell me where is fancy bredʼ (Shakespeare The merchant of
Venice, 3.2.63–72).07/09/2024, 14:04 Plays and poetry | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/plays-and-poetry 10/13Use sentence case.
For direct quotes, include the author and date, if known. If the date isnʼt known, use the title.
Use ‘Anonʼ if the author is unknown.

Author–date (/referencing-and-attribution/author-date)>Works of art
Works of art
Cite works of art using the author–date system. Attribute artwork with correct
references to help people find the source and relevant information.
Cite works of art correctly
Works of art include:
paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures and ceramics
other physical artworks such as street and neon sign art
ephemeral and performance artwork
antiquities – objects from ancient times such as coins and pottery
posters, maps, clip art, photographs and cartoons
digital art – art created using technology such as video, computer or laser beam.
You might need to reference works of art for exhibitions and programs or when using
decorative images in digital content. The reference must:
provide all the information someone needs to identify the work properly
comply with copyright laws.
Examples of in-text citations and reference lists on this page follow the author–date system,
as this is the most common way of citing works of art in government content.07/09/2024, 14:04 Works of art | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/works-art 1/11Copyright requirements
You must attribute copyright material you reference. This includes images and works
of art.
Include all the details required by open access licences (read how to attribute Creative
Commons (https://creativecommons.org.au/learn/fact-sheets/attribution/)).
Read the government copyright rules in the Australian Government intellectual
property manual (https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/media-
centre/publications/australian-government-intellectual-property-manual).
Prioritise accessibility
Images, including works of art, may be inaccessible to:
people who have low vision
people who use screen readers to access content
users of mobile phones.
When including images of art in content, ensure they:
are sized for easier viewing
will display correctly on mobile phones or other small screen devices
can be made larger by people, without loss of content or functionality
include alt text so that descriptions of the image can be read by screen readers or
mobile users wishing to limit data usage.
Use of the author–date system also improves accessibility. It places references within the
main text so there is no need for superscript reference markers. This helps make references
readable for screen readers and more accessible to mobile users.
Accessibility requirements
Only include images on a page if they meet a real user need.
Prepare short alt text for images (/node/49) and describe the relevant features of the
work of art in the discussion to explain the relevance of the image.07/09/2024, 14:04 Works of art | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/works-art 2/11WCAG quick reference: Non-text content – level A
(https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#non-text-content)
Use italics and sentence case for
artwork titles
Italicise the titles of individual artworks and use sentence case.
Sometimes the artist has made a different typographic choice for the title. If so, follow the
capitalisation of the original. Include any numbers or punctuation in exactly the same way as
the artist does.
From the second mention, you can use a shortened version of the name if it makes sense.
If the title is in another language, write it in that language. Use the exact spelling. You can
include the English translation of the title.
Other titles of artworks
Sometimes people call works of art by a name other than that given to them by the artist.
Italicise the informal names of artworks in the same way that you would with the formal titles.Example
Margaret Olleyʼs Portrait in the mirror is one of her notable works. Portrait is usually
included in retrospectives of Olleyʼs work.
Parliamentʼs forecourt mosaic is based on Michael Nelson Jagamaraʼs Possum and
Wallaby Dreaming.
Robinson won the Wynne Prize for Creation landscape – earth and sea. Creation is a
stunning example of Robinsonʼs understanding of light.
William Yaxley used mandarin peel in his sculpture, The mangrove monster no. 2.
Bessie Davidson's Fleurs (flowers), completed in 1942, was sold in 2017.
Example07/09/2024, 14:04 Works of art | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/works-art 3/11Untitled works
Sometimes an artist may choose to call a work ‘Untitledʼor not give it a name. Write
‘Untitledʼ in italics with an initial capital letter. Include the year of production and the artistʼs
name.
You might not be able to find the year of production. In this case, include the artistʼs name
and the medium of the work in square brackets.
Use title case and italics for artwork
series
An individual artwork is sometimes part of a series. Write the titles of series of unique works
of art in italics. Use title case (maximal capitalisation). Write the titles of the individual works
of art in the series in italics, too. Capitalise and punctuate according to the original title.
Modern works in a series might not use capital letters at all.Jackson Pollock titled his 1952 work Number 11 before it became known as Blue poles in
a 1954 exhibition.
Example
Hunterʼs Untitled (1968) is part of the permanent collection in the Museum of
Contemporary Art.
Dinhʼs Untitled [oil on hardboard] was recently purchased for a private collection.
Example
The exhibition included Coffin with flowers and potterʼs wheel with landscape
decoration, a drawing in the Potter series by Arthur Boyd.
Sidney Nolanʼs Ned Kelly series is currently touring Australia. Nedʼs sister Margaret
features in one of the works, Quilting the armour, painted in 1947.07/09/2024, 14:04 Works of art | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/works-art 4/11Use the details you have to cite
ephemeral and performance art
Ephemeral and performance art can be difficult to cite. The key points to remember are:
Use the artworkʼs correct name in use at a particular time.
Follow style rules for titles and series. For example, write the title as the artist has and
use italics for published works.
Include context and details about the artwork to help people understand the work.
Itʼs important to include detailed information because:
changing technology blurs the line between art forms and results in new art forms
art forms change name and format
the phrase ‘work of artʼ includes the use of social media by the artist to discuss the
artwork
the term ‘artʼ may extend to and include the discussion of a work of art on social media.
Use roman type for exhibition titles
Write the titles of exhibitions in roman type and use the same capitalisation as the museum
or gallery uses.Example
flight research #6 is part of Rosemary Laingʼs Flight Research series.
Example
Wrapped Coast, One Million Square Feet, Little Bay, Sydney, Australia was a work
undertaken by artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude in 1968 and 1969. They used erosion-
control fabric and polypropylene rope to wrap the coastline of Little Bay, where it

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date/works-art 5/11Use italics for titles of exhibition catalogues
The titles of exhibition catalogues usually have the same name as the exhibition.
Treat catalogues as books. Write catalogue titles in italics and use sentence case for the
title.
Exhibition catalogues in a reference list
Include the name of the exhibition and the format of the catalogue in the reference list. After
the title of the exhibition, include the full start and end dates for the exhibition.
Rule: Author or Gallery Name (Year) Title of exhibition [format], Day Month Year of exhibition,
Publisher, Location of Gallery.
For online catalogues, hyperlink the title of the catalogue and include an accessed date. If
the catalogue is a PDF, link to the page where the PDF is hosted, instead of to the PDF. If you
canʼt link to a host page, include ‘PDFʼ in square brackets after the format information.
Rule: Author or Gallery Name (Year) Title of exhibition [format] [PDF], Day Month Year of
exhibition, Publisher, Place, accessed Day Month Year.Example

Bills and explanatory material
Cite bills and explanatory material using the right style to help people find the
source material.
Style for bill titles is roman type, title
case
A bill is a draft Act introduced into parliament. A bill becomes an Act when the Governor-
General gives assent to the bill after the Senate and House of Representatives agree on its
content.
Write the titles of bills in roman type, not italics.
Bills have a:
short title (its name), which includes the year
long title (a description).
In general, use the short title. Use title case (maximal capitalisation). There is no comma
between the title and year.
The long title uses sentence case.
Example
Refugee Protection Bill 2019 [Short title]07/09/2024, 14:05 Bills and explanatory material | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/bills-and-explanatory-material 1/7Lower case is correct, unless the
reference is to a specific bill
Always use an initial capital for the word ‘Billʼ when you write about a specific bill: ‘the Billʼ,
‘this Billʼ.
If you are writing about 2 or more bills, use the lower case: ‘the billsʼ, ‘these billsʼ.
If you write about a bill or bills generally, use the lower case: ‘a billʼ, ‘some billsʼ.
For bills, people are unlikely to find the lower case forms confusing. If thereʼs any chance the
text is unclear to readers, use a capital ‘Bʼ.
The basic unit of a bill is a clause (cl)
Bills contain clauses, which become sections when bills become Acts. Clauses can be
divided into subclauses, then into paragraphs and then into subparagraphs. Use lower case
for these units of a bill unless they begin a sentence.
Long bills have clauses grouped into parts, divisions and subdivisions. Always use an initial
capital for these units, for example ‘Part 1ʼ.
Bills often contain schedules. These are not units but are components of bills, Acts and some
delegated legislation.A Bill for an Act to provide a legislative response to all people seeking asylum in
Australia, and for related purposes [Long title]
Example
The government drafted a legislative package that includes 3 bills:
the Religious Discrimination Bill 2019
the Religious Discrimination (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019
the Human Rights Legislation Amendment (Freedom of Religion) Bill 2019.07/09/2024, 14:05 Bills and explanatory material | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/bills-and-explanatory-material 2/7Units below clause level
Commonwealth bills refer to units below clause level using the smallest unit of text. This is a
convention used by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in legislative drafting. Some
jurisdictions cite at clause level.
Whether to cite at clause level or below will depend on the context for your content. You can
choose which method to follow.
Content that discusses the operation and effect of certain subclauses, paragraphs and
subparagraphs will cite at the smallest unit level. A general discussion about the provisions
of a bill will cite at clause level.
Follow in-house style. Otherwise, be guided by the type of content youʼre writing, and its
purpose and audience.
Shortened forms for units
The shortened forms of ‘clauseʼ and ‘clausesʼ are ‘clʼ and ‘clsʼ. Write them in lower case and
without a full stop.
The shortened forms of ‘subclauseʼ and ‘subclausesʼ are ‘subclʼ and ‘subclsʼ.
The other units of bills mentioned above are also found in Acts.
You can use both the long and shortened forms of units for in-text citation and notes. To
decide which to use, think about the type of content, its users and the amount of legal
material cited in it. If the long form better helps people understand the text, use it.Example
These citations specify the smallest unit of text:
clause 9
subclause 9(4)
paragraph 9(4)(a)
subparagraph 9(4)(a)(ii).
Other jurisdictions might cite the subparagraph as ‘clause 9(4)(a)(ii)ʼ. [A citation at
clause level]07/09/2024, 14:05 Bills and explanatory material | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/bills-and-explanatory-material 3/7Explanatory material titles use roman
type, title case
Explanatory material includes explanatory memoranda and explanatory statements.
An explanatory memorandum is a document tabled in parliament with a bill. It explains the
objective of a proposed law and how it will operate. The Australian Government has provided
explanatory memoranda with all government bills since 1982.
An explanatory statement is a similar document that accompanies delegated legislation such
as regulations and determinations.
Write titles in roman type. Use title case for the titles of explanatory material.
Donʼt use capitals for ‘explanatory memorandaʼ and ‘explanatory statementsʼ when writing
about explanatory material in the general sense.
For content that mentions explanatory material often, use these shortened forms:
EM (explanatory memorandum)
EMs (explanatory memoranda or memorandums)
ES (explanatory statement or statements).
Write them in parentheses at first mention and use the shortened form after that.Example
Clause 12 vests Commonwealth powers in the Minister …
The Underwater Cultural Heritage Bill 2018 provides automatic protection for the
remains of vessels located in Australian waters for at least 75 years (paragraph 16(1)(a)).
 Commonwealth Registers Bill 2019, subcl 25(1).1
Example
Material that does not form part of an Act (extrinsic material) can be used in the
interpretation of an Act. Extrinsic material includes explanatory memorandums (EMs).
The Legislation Register attaches an EM to each bill that is introduced.07/09/2024, 14:05 Bills and explanatory material | Style Manual

Acts of parliament
Refer to Acts of parliament using the correct style so people can find the
source material. Choose when to cite the short and long titles, series numbers,
jurisdiction and sections.
Style for Act titles is title case, not
always italics
Use title case (maximal capitalisation) for the titles of Acts. Use italics for the first mention of
these titles.
Use roman type for the titles of Acts in reference lists and other long lists. Blocks of italics
are difficult to read.
The year the legislation is first enacted forms part of the title. Donʼt use a comma before the
year.
Correct
Export Control Act 2020
Incorrect
Export control Act, 202007/09/2024, 14:05 Acts of parliament | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/acts-parliament 1/12Include all the words in the title. If the title begins with ‘Theʼ, ‘Anʼ or ‘Aʼ, make sure you include
it.
If the Actʼs title has a number, include the number exactly as written. The contraction ‘No.ʼ
retains the full stop in this situation, which is an exception to the general rule for the
shortened form for ‘numberʼ (/node/191#only_use_the_contraction_no_with_numerals).
An Act has a short title (its name) and long title (a description). Both appear after the list of
contents in the text of the Act. The long title appears as a heading before section 1 of the
Act. The short title is named in section 1.
At first mention, use the short title in italics
The first time you name the Act in text, use the short title in italics.Example
A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999
The Commercial Bank of Australia Limited (Merger) Act 1982 (NSW)
Example
Supply Act (No. 1) 2019–2020
Farm Household Support Amendment (Relief Measures) Act (No. 2) 2019
Example

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/acts-parliament 2/12After first mention, use the short title in roman type without
the year
Always use the short title in italics the first time you cite the Act in your text.
If there are subsequent mentions of the Act, use the short title in roman type without the
year.
Add the shortened form in parentheses at the first mention if it does more than just remove
the year or the word ‘Actʼ from the title.
Or use the informal title in roman type
Often, Acts also have a shorter informal title. This is usually an initialism or acronym of the
short title.
At first mention, include the informal title in parentheses after the title. Use the informal title
after that.
Use title case and roman type for the informal title.‘legal tenderʼ.
Example
… was convicted of federal offences under the Crimes Act 1914. The Crimes Act

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/acts-parliament 3/12Each Act has a series number to use in
citations
Acts are also identified by series. Every Act made in a year is given a number starting at 1.
The series appears in the text of the Act immediately under the title, for example ‘Act No. 137
of 1979ʼ.
Using the series in general content helps people identify the particular Act and find it in the
Legislation Register. Series are also used in annotations and in notes.
Jurisdiction is an important detail
It is important to identify the jurisdiction of the Act – that is, whether it is an Act of:
the Commonwealth
a state or territory.
This helps people find the Act and understand where it applies. There are 2 ways to do this.
Write a sentence that makes jurisdiction clear
The first way is to write a sentence that explains where the Act originates. This method is
useful in documents that donʼt mention legislation frequently.Example
The Australian Citizenship Act 2007, by virtue of amendments made in 2013 (Act No. 57
of 2013), gives the Minister the discretionary power to …
Example
The Tasmanian Local Government Act 1993 gave councils greater autonomy to act
independently of the state government.
Tasmaniaʼs Local Government Act 1993 …07/09/2024, 14:05 Acts of parliament | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/acts-parliament 4/12Use the shortened form of the jurisdiction in the Actʼs title in
roman type and in parentheses
Alternatively, insert the jurisdictionʼs shortened form in roman type in parentheses after the
italicised title.
Use these shortened forms:
Cth (the Commonwealth)
ACT (Australian Capital Territory)
NT (Northern Territory)
NSW (New South Wales)
Qld (Queensland)
SA (South Australia)
Tas (Tasmania)
Vic (Victoria)
WA (Western Australia).
None of these shortened forms for jurisdictions are punctuated.
An initial capital is correct, whether the
reference is generic or not
Always use capitals for the words ‘Actʼ and ‘Actsʼ when you write about Acts of parliament.
This avoids possible confusion in publications, even those that are mostly about the law. The
words ‘actʼ and ‘actsʼ have several meanings.Example
Australiaʼs water resources in the Murray–Darling Basin are managed by laws of the
Commonwealth and Basin States. Among others, this legislation includes the Water Act
2007(Cth), Water Resources Act 2007(ACT), Water Management Act 2000(NSW),
Water Act 2000(Qld), Natural Resources Management Act 2004(SA) and Water Act
1989(Vic).
Dugong are defined as ‘fishʼ for the purposes of the Marine Act 1981(NT).07/09/2024, 14:05 Acts of parliament | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/acts-parliament 5/12The basic unit of an Act is a section (s)
An Act contains sections, which are often divided into subsections. Subsections might be
divided into paragraphs and subparagraphs.
Use lower case for these units unless they begin a sentence.
Sections are usually grouped into parts, divisions and subdivisions. An Act only has
subdivisions if there are divisions. Some larger Acts – for example, the Criminal Code Act
1995 – group these units into chapters.
Always use an initial capital for a specific reference to a ‘Chapterʼ, ‘Partʼ, ‘Divisionʼ or
‘Subdivisionʼ.
Choose how to cite units below section level
Commonwealth Acts cite units at the smallest unit below section level. This is a convention
used by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in legislative drafting.
Some jurisdictions cite at section level.
Whether to cite at section level or below will depend on the context for your content. You can
choose which method to follow.Example
Staff must read the Act to understand their compliance responsibilities.
Example
These citations specify the smallest unit of text:
section 113V
subsection 113V(4)
paragraph 113V(4)(a)
subparagraph 113V(4)(a)(ii).
Other jurisdictions might cite as ‘section 113V(4)(a)(ii)ʼ. [A citation at section level]07/09/2024, 14:05 Acts of parliament | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/acts-parliament 6/12Content that discuss the operation and effect of certain subsections, paragraphs and
subparagraphs will cite at the smallest unit level. A general discussion about the provisions
of an Act might only cite at section level.
Follow in-house style. Otherwise, be guided by the type of content youʼre writing, and its
purpose and audience.
Donʼt use a full stop after the shortened forms of units
The units of an Act are written in long or shortened form (an abbreviation or contraction),
depending on the context. Never begin a sentence with the shortened form.
Donʼt use a full stop after the shortened form when you use it in a citation or note.

Reference to Australiaʼs Constitution
needs capitalisation only
Always capitalise ‘Constitutionʼ when writing about Australiaʼs Constitution.
The Constitution was enacted by the British Parliament. The long title of the Act is the
Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (UK).
Like all foreign Acts of parliament, it is written in roman type, not italics.
The original version is available on the UK Government Legislation website
(https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/63-64/12/contents/enacted). A compilation
including amendments is on the Legislation Register
(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004Q00685).
How you refer to Australiaʼs Constitution depends on the context.
Write ‘the Constitutionʼ when itʼs clear that youʼre referring to Australiaʼs Constitution.
If youʼre unsure, use ‘the Australian Constitutionʼ so thereʼs no confusion.

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/acts-parliament 9/12The digital edition departs from sixth edition guidance about the capitalisation, punctuation
and italicisation of citation elements for some legal material. The current edition also

These departures are informed by legal material and general publications from Australian

digital edition style is for general, rather than specialist, legal content.
The Content Guide briefly mentioned legislation in relation to capitalisation. There was no

Schedules
Refer to schedules that appear at the end of legislation using style conventions.
Follow the drafting rules for amending and non-amending schedules so people
can find the source information.
Schedules are components of legislation 
Schedules are components (not units) of bills, Acts and some instruments. They appear at
the end of legislation. Schedules are either amending or non-amending.
Amending schedules are more common. There are drafting rules about their use and the
order in which each schedule appears.
Most amending schedules list amendments to other Acts, bills and instruments that will take
effect when the legislation commences. Some contain other provisions such as savings and
transitional arrangements.
Non-amending schedules have many different purposes. Units of non-amending schedules
are named differently depending on the purpose. Non-amending schedules sometimes
include text that could be contained in the body of the legislation as a section. In this case,
the basic unit is a clause.
Cite at schedule level, not the basic unit level, for most content.07/09/2024, 14:05 Schedules | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/schedules 1/4Style for schedule titles is an initial
capital
Use capital ‘Sʼ for long and shortened forms of named schedules.
Always capitalise ‘Scheduleʼ or ‘Schedulesʼ when you write the title of schedules or refer to
particular schedules.
The shortened form is ‘Schʼ for singular and plural.
The basic unit of an amending schedule
is an item
For most texts, you donʼt need to identify the units of different types of schedules or to
decide how units should be cited. It is enough to cite at schedule level.
Amending schedules are divided into parts, then into divisions. Both are given arabic
numerals – for example, Part 1 Division 3. Divisions contain items divided into subitems,
which are given numbers in parentheses – (1), (2) and so on.
There is no shortened form for ‘itemʼ or ‘subitemʼ.

Delegated legislation
Follow the correct style to cite delegated legislation made under the authority
of an Act. This will help people find the source material.
Delegated legislation comes in many
forms
Delegated legislation is made under the authority of an Act, not by the Act directly. For
example, parliament may delegate this authority to a minister, statutory bodies or office
holders.
Regulations are the most common type of delegated legislation. There are many others,
including:
determinations
ordinances
proclamations
orders
rules
by-laws
standards
principles.
Some jurisdictions refer to delegated legislation as ‘subordinate legislationʼ, ‘subsidiary
legislationʼ or ‘statutory rulesʼ.07/09/2024, 14:05 Delegated legislation | Style Manual

(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A01224). All legislative instruments are
registered on the Legislation Register (https://www.legislation.gov.au/Home). Regulations are
legislative instruments.
The Legislation Register also contains notifiable instruments
(https://www.legislation.gov.au/Browse/ByTitle/NotifiableInstruments/). These are not
legislative, but are notices about legal matters of interest to the public. An example is the
Order to Call Out the Australian Defence Force Reserves [No. 2], made during Australiaʼs
bushfire crisis in 2020.
Style for regulations titles is roman type,
title case
Use title case (maximal capitalisation) and roman type for the titles of regulations. 
Always capitalise ‘Regulationsʼ or ‘Regulationʼ when you write the title of regulations and
refer to particular regulations.
Cite the title exactly without altering the spelling. The year forms part of the title. There is no
comma between title and year.
The basic unit of regulations is a
regulation (reg)
Regulations are compilations made up of individual regulations. Each regulation might be
divided into subregulations.Example
The Ombudsman Regulations 2017 is an instrument made under the Ombudsman Act
1976. These Regulations …
Superannuation Industry Supervision Regulations 1994 (Cth)
Workersʼ Compensation and Injury Management Regulations 1982 (WA)07/09/2024, 14:05 Delegated legislation | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/delegated-legislation 2/8Use lower case when citing an individual regulation or subregulation, unless they begin a
sentence.
Some titles are singular so check to make sure you write the title correctly. A singular
regulation still contains regulations and subregulations.
The shortened forms of regulations and subregulations are:
reg
regs
subreg
subregs.
Regulations receive a unique identifier when registered on the Legislation Register – for
example, F2019C00400 (Ombudsman Regulations 2017). You can use the identifier to
search for regulations or to point users to earlier superseded regulations.Example
… pursuant to regulation 58 of Defence Regulation 2016. [Note the full title of the
Regulation is singular]
Regulation 4A and subregulation 4AA(2) of the Customs (Prohibited Imports)
Regulations 1956. [Note the full title of the Regulations is plural.]
The Regulations deal with the importation of plastic explosives into Australia (regulation
4AA).
Example
An authorised officer under the Water Act 2007 will be issued with an identity card
… The associated regulations specify other mandatory features of the card, including
the Commonwealth Coat of Arms (Water Regulations 2008, reg 10.1).
Example
… the licence variations prescribed in the Water Amendment Regulation 2012 (No. 1)
(F2012L01015).07/09/2024, 14:05 Delegated legislation | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/delegated-legislation 3/8Other delegated legislation follows title
case, no italics
Style for all other titles of delegated legislation is the same as for regulations. 
Use roman type and title case for citations that give the full title.
Use an initial capital for a reference to a specific instrument. Use lower case for generic
references.
Determinations
Use the long form ‘Determinationʼ for in-text citations and notes.
Use a capital ‘Dʼ when you refer to a particular determination or to determinations.
Use a lower case ‘dʼ when you write about generic determinations.
Orders
Use the long forms ‘Orderʼ and ‘Ordersʼ for in-text citations and notes.
Use a capital ‘Oʼ when you refer to a particular order or to orders.Example
Remuneration Tribunal (Members of Parliament) Determination No. 2 2019, Part 6
Financial Management Determination 2019 (Tas)
Example
Under section 10 of the Australian Passports Determination 2015. This Determination ...
The Act allows benefits to be varied by determination of the Remuneration Tribunal.
Example
Marine Order 44 (Safe Containers) 2019, subsection 6(1)07/09/2024, 14:05 Delegated legislation | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/delegated-legislation 4/8Use a lower case ‘oʼ when you write about generic orders.
Ordinances
Use the long forms ‘Ordinanceʼ and ‘Ordinancesʼ for in-text citations and notes.
Use a capital ‘Oʼ when you refer to a particular ordinance.
Use a lower case ‘oʼ when you write about generic ordinances.
Acts in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory were known as ordinances
until self-government.
Rules
A rule is made by judges or legislation setting out how a court will conduct its proceedings.
Donʼt use ‘ruleʼ and ‘rulingʼ interchangeably. They are different things. Rulings are
authoritative decisions made by a court or similar body about matters before them.
Use a capital ‘Rʼ when you refer to a particular rule or rules.Example
The calculation methods for associate deferred pension annual rates are prescribed by
the Judgesʼ Pensions Order 2013, section 8. The Order … [A specific reference]
In Australia, exports are regulated through legislation, regulations and orders. [A generic
reference]
Example
Administration Ordinance 1990 (Jervis Bay Territory), section 3A
Example
… the Norfolk Island Administrator Ordinance 2016. The Ordinance …
The Governor-General has the power to make ordinances for the peace, order and good
government of the Jervis Bay Territory.07/09/2024, 14:05 Delegated legislation | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/delegated-legislation 5/8Use a lower case ‘rʼ when you write about generic rules.
Units for rules are ‘rulesʼ and ‘subrulesʼ.
Use lower case for their shortened forms:
r (rule)
subr (subrule)
rr (rules)
subrr (subrules).

Legal material (/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material)>Cases and legal authorities
Cases and legal authorities
Cite cases, rulings and determinations using the correct style. Accuracy helps
people find the source material. Specify the law report or online legal authority
that hosts the relevant judgment or decision.
Style for case names is title case, not
always italics
A case is a matter to be settled at law. It is also an instance or the process of making a claim
in a court of law. Legal authorities are published sources of legal reasoning, doctrine and
rulings made by courts and similar bodies.
The people or organisations named in the case are known as ‘partiesʼ. Capitalise the names
of the parties but use a lower case ‘vʼ between the party names. There is no full stop after ‘vʼ.
Case names have this basic form: Party v Party.
Write the name of the case in italics. This rule is for case names that are mentioned briefly in
general content.
Use roman type for cases in reference lists and other long lists. Blocks of italics are difficult
to read.
Always write the names as they appear in your source.
Example
In Commonwealth v Tasmania …07/09/2024, 14:05 Cases and legal authorities | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/cases-and-legal-authorities 1/14The abbreviated title is in italics
Cases are often known by an abbreviated title. On first mention of the case name, follow it
with the abbreviated title in parentheses. For in-text references, write this title in italics and
use title case (maximal capitalisation). You can then use the abbreviated title throughout the
content.
Do not capitalise ‘the caseʼ or ‘this caseʼ.
The full citation gives users detail they
might need
Most government writing about cases requires a full citation. Citations show people where to
find the published authorised judgments and decisions of courts, commissions and tribunals.
They also tell people who made the decision and what year it was made.
Citations can be in text or in notes, depending on organisational style and the format of the
content.
Decisions are either reported or
unreported
Reported decisions are published in authorised law reports (a report series). For example:
Commonwealth Law Reports (CLR) contain authorised reports of High Court decisions.The article discusses an important case in the High Court, Commonwealth v Tasmania.
Example
… the important case in the High Court, Commonwealth v Tasmania (Tasmanian Dam
Case). The case saw the Commonwealth …
… the State of New South Wales v The Commonwealth(Wheat Case). The Wheat Case
…07/09/2024, 14:05 Cases and legal authorities | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/cases-and-legal-authorities 2/14Federal Court Reports (FCR) contain authorised reports of the Federal Court.
Industrial Reports (IR) contain decisions of the Commonwealth Fair Work Commission.
Always cite an authorised report if it is available.
Unreported decisions are published in report series from the legal authorities themselves.
For example:
High Court of Australia (HCA)
Federal Court of Australia (FCA)
Fair Work Commission (FWC).
The abbreviations for the report series of reported and unreported decisions are different.
Some unreported decisions are published in a report series later on. This is why the same
case might have 2 or more citations.
Use parentheses (round brackets) for reported decisions that use consecutive volume
numbers for the whole series. This means you donʼt have to use the year to find the volume
on the shelf.
Use square brackets for reported decisions that use the year as a volume number. This
means you must look for the year first, then for volume 1, 2 and so on. Other years would
also have a volume 1.
The authorised report of a case might have been published some time after the decision was
handed down.Example
Reported decision with consecutive volume numbers for the whole series:
name of the case: The State of New South Wales v The Commonwealth
year of decision: (1915)
volume of report series: 20
report series abbreviation: CLR
page number where the report begins: 54
[The full in-text citation or note is The State of New South Wales v The Commonwealth
(1915) 20 CLR 54 (Wheat Case).]07/09/2024, 14:05 Cases and legal authorities | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/cases-and-legal-authorities 3/14Unreported decisions are always in square brackets. There is no volume number, as the case
is not part of an authorised report series. The legal authority publishes the report in its own
series.
Civil and criminal case titles have
different elements
Civil and criminal cases have specific citation elements. They differ.Example
Reported decision with the year as a volume number:
name of the case: Kashemije Stud Pty Ltd v Hawkes
year of report: [1978]
volume of report series: 1
report series abbreviation: NSWLR
page number where the report begins: 143
[The full in-text citation or note is Kashemije Stud Pty Ltd v Hawkes [1978] 1 NSWLR
143. It tells you when the authorised report was published in the New South Wales Law
Reports. This might not be the year the NSW Supreme Court handed down the
decision.]
Example
Unreported decision with no volume number:
name of the case: The State of NSW v The Commonwealth
year of decision: [1915]
volume of report series: (not reported in a volume)
report series abbreviation: HCA
judgment number [relates to year of decision]: 17
[The full in-text citation or note is The State of New South Wales v The Commonwealth
[1915] HCA 17 (Wheat Case). This citation tells you the High Court of Australia published
the decision.]07/09/2024, 14:05 Cases and legal authorities | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/cases-and-legal-authorities 4/14In civil case titles, the ‘vʼ is pronounced ‘andʼ. In criminal case titles, the ‘vʼ is pronounced
‘againstʼ.
For civil case titles, specify the first plaintiff and defendant
Civil cases usually involve a dispute between organisations or individuals. The plaintiff is the
person or organisation who files a complaint with the court. The other party is the defendant.
Most citations use only family names. Corporation names are usually given in full, although
abbreviations are acceptable.
Usually, citations use only the name of the first-mentioned party on each side of a case.
Other parties are sometimes noted by the phrases:
‘and Othersʼ or ‘& Orsʼ
‘and Anotherʼ or ‘& Anorʼ.
In civil cases, use sentence case and italics for ‘Reʼ and ‘Ex
parteʼ
Sometimes the title of cases includes the terms ‘Reʼ and ‘Ex parteʼ. Use sentence case and
write both in italics.
‘Reʼ means ‘in the matter ofʼ and that is how it is said. ‘Reʼ in the title of a civil case means
the court acts in a particular way – for example, in an advisory capacity.Example
Koowarta v Bjelke-Peterson (1982) 153 CLR 168
[The plaintiff was Koowarta, the defendant was Bjelke-Peterson]
Example
SZIBU and Another v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2007] FCA
108
The State of Victoria and Others v The Commonwealth (1926) 38 CLR 399
Cunningham & Ors v Commonwealth of Australia & Anor [2016] HCA 3907/09/2024, 14:05 Cases and legal authorities | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/cases-and-legal-authorities 5/14‘Ex parteʼ means an application brought before the court by one party without the other
party having to be notified – for example, when one party applies for an injunction.
For criminal case titles, list all defendants
Criminal cases are usually initiated by the Commonwealth or state (for the Crown) against
people or organisations (the defendants) who are alleged to have committed an offence
under criminal law.
List the names of all defendants separated by a comma.
If prosecuting, the Crown is signified by an ‘Rʼ without a full stop. This is a Latin abbreviation
for ‘Rexʼ or ‘Reginaʼ, meaning ‘Kingʼor ‘Queenʼ.
If the Crown is the respondent in a criminal appeal, reverse the parties and write ‘Appellant v
The Kingʼ (not ‘Rʼ). If the Crown is the appellant, ‘The Kingʼ is the first party cited.
'The King' or 'The Queen' in the title is always retained as first published. The title does not
change when the monarch changes.Example
Nduta v Minister for Immigration & Border Protection [2016] FCA 1596; Re Minister for
Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1; 74 ALJR
405.
An Ex parte application of Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police ...
Example
R v Bayda, R v Namoa (No 8) [2019] NSWSC 24 [The Crown against Bayda and Namoa
as defendants]
R v Alice Lynne Chamberlain and Michael Leigh Chamberlain [1982] NTSC [The Crown
against Alice (Lindy) and Michael Chamberlain as defendants]
Example
Chamberlain v The Queen (1984) 153 CLR 521

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/cases-and-legal-authorities 6/14Subsequent citations in notes use the
first party
When citing cases using notes, always use a full citation as the first citation. After that, you
can use the name of the first party, followed by the case citation.
Pinpoint citations use ‘atʼ for page and
paragraph numbers
If you use notes, write pinpoint page numbers for the citation using ‘at [page number]ʼ.
You can follow the page number with the number of the relevant paragraph as it appears in
the judgment. Write the paragraph number in square brackets.
Use a comma to list separate pinpoint citations.House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 49
Example
Steinmetzv Shannon (2019) 99 NSWLR 687. [The full citation the first time]

https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/cases-and-legal-authorities 8/14investigate matters
settle claims and disputes.
Most tribunals are established by Acts of parliament which set out their powers, functions
and operations. Acts give tribunals the legal authority to make decisions. There are tribunals
in each state and territory. 
Under the Constitution, only federal courts have the judicial power of the Commonwealth.
Commonwealth tribunals exercise administrative rather than judicial power.
Federal courts cannot review administrative decisions made by government, so parliament
often gives this power to a tribunal.
The president and members of a tribunal can be judges. For example, the President of the
Administrative Appeals Tribunal is a judge of the Federal Court of Australia.
Find the decision title on the tribunal website or an
alternative 
Decisions are published on tribunal websites, on the Federal Court of Australiaʼs website
(https://www.fedcourt.gov.au/digital-law-library/judgments/search) or on AustLII
(http://www.austlii.edu.au/).
There are a large number of Commonwealth tribunals, including:
the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) (https://www.aat.gov.au/)
the Australian Competition Tribunal (https://www.competitiontribunal.gov.au/)
the Copyright Tribunal of Australia (https://www.copyrighttribunal.gov.au/)
the Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal
(https://www.defenceappeals.gov.au/practice-directions)
the Fair Work Commission (https://www.fwc.gov.au/)
the National Native Title Tribunal (http://www.nntt.gov.au/Pages/Home-Page.aspx).
The AAT has an authorised report series – the Administrative Law Decisions (ALD). The
AATʼs unauthorised report series, AATA, is available on AustLII.
The Fair Work Commission also has an authorised report series – the Industrial Reports (IR).
Unauthorised reports are available on the commissionʼs website.
Always cite the authorised report if it has been published and you have access to it.07/09/2024, 14:05 Cases and legal authorities | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/cases-and-legal-authorities 9/14Titles for Tax Commissioner rulings have
unique elements
The Commissioner of Taxation has the power to make rulings – public, private and oral – that
interpret the laws administered by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).
Public rulings comprise rulings and determinations and are legally binding advice. Draft and
final public rulings are published on the ATO Legal Database (https://www.ato.gov.au/Law).
The full titles of public rulings have 3 elements that appear in a set order:
 . a ruling or determination type – for example, ‘Goods and Services Tax Rulingʼ
 . a number – for example, ‘GSTR 2019/1ʼ
 . a title in italics – for example, Goods and services tax: supply of anything other than
goods or real property connected with the indirect tax zone (Australia).
Write the full title at first mention.Example

For subsequent mentions, write the type of ruling or determination or write the number.
Use an initial capital when you refer to specific rulings.
In notes, cite the title, source and paragraph numbers
If you use notes, cite the ATO Legal Database as the source.

Treaties
Treaties are made under international law. Follow the correct style to help
people to access titles, series information and detailed citations.
Treaty citations need the correct title
and series information
A treaty is an international agreement that is binding under international law. The
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade explains the different types of treaties and how they
are made in the Treaty making process (https://dfat.gov.au/international-
relations/treaties/treaty-making-process/Pages/treaty-making-process.aspx).
Sometimes a Commonwealth Act of parliament is required to give effect to a treaty – for
example, the Antarctic Treaty Act 1960.
Treaties also include conventions, international agreements, covenants, an exchange of
letters, international instruments, charters or protocols.
Treaties appear in various official series published by countries and international
organisations.
Australian treaties are published in the Australian Treaty Series (ATS). Other series include
the United Nations Treaty Series (UNTS), the United States Treaties and Other International
Agreements (UST) and the United Kingdom Treaty Series (UKTS).
To search for the titles, short titles and series information for treaties that Australia has
signed or taken other action on, use the Australian Treaties Database
(https://dfat.gov.au/international-relations/treaties/Pages/treaties.aspx). You can also use07/09/2024, 14:05 Treaties | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/treaties 1/6AustLIIʼs Australian Treaties Library. (http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/index.html)
For other series, use the WorldLII Treaties and International Agreements
(http://www.worldlii.org/catalog/2266.html) database catalogue. Alternatively, go directly to
the relevant databases. These include the United Nations Treaty Collection
(https://treaties.un.org/), UK Treaties Online
(https://treaties.fco.gov.uk/responsive/app/consolidatedSearch/) and, for the US, Treaties
and Other International Acts Series (https://www.state.gov/tias/).
Style for treaty titles is roman type, title
case
Write titles of treaties in roman type with title case (maximal capitalisation). Follow the full
title with the short title in parentheses and use the short title after that.
The year the treaty is made does not form part of the title. If you include it, write it into the
sentence or add it in parentheses after the short title.
In general publications, citing the title of the treaty is usually enough.Example
The South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty (SPNFP) is also known as the Treaty of
Rarotonga.
Example
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) (1966)
Example
Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes
and their Disposal (Basel Convention). Australian signed the Basel Convention in 1992.
The Charter of the Organization of African Unity was adopted by participating
governments in May 1963.07/09/2024, 14:05 Treaties | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/treaties 2/6Detailed citations for treaties have many
elements
You might need a detailed citation for an in-text citation, notes or a reference list.
Write the citation this way:
title
(place of making, date of making)
[year treaty entered into force]  
treaty series and volume number
page number in the series volume.
Donʼt use any punctuation between the elements.
The square brackets follow the style used in the Australian Treaties Database.
(Tip: Use the 'registered' year to search the database for the year a treaty entered into force
in the United Nations Treaty Collection (https://treaties.un.org/).
If a short title has been introduced and used in the text, you can use the short title in the
note.
Always use the long title in a reference list.Example
Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes
and their Disposal (Basel, 22 March 1989) [1992] UNTS 1673 p 57.
Singapore–Australia Free Trade Agreement (Singapore, 17 February 2003) [2003] ATS

Legal material (/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material)>Authoritative reports
Authoritative reports
Case citations rely on authorised and unauthorised law report series. Use the
correct abbreviations for Australian law report series. This will help people find
the judgements you cite.
Cite an authorised law report if one is
available
When you are referring to case law, you will generally cite a law report.
There are Commonwealth, state and territory law reports. They contain court judgments in
cases that are important for legal reasons.
Reported cases generally set a precedent for similar cases. A written judgement is a useful
summary of the key points of a case.
Not all court decisions are published. Where they are not published, they are called
unreported judgments. Unreported judgments are less persuasive than reported judgments.
Authorised and unauthorised reports
Citations use common abbreviations for the titles of law reports. A law report is part of either
an authorised or unauthorised report series.
The courts review, annotate and approve authorised law reports for publication.Wherever
you can, cite an authorised law report using the relevant abbreviation.07/09/2024, 14:06 Authoritative reports | Style Manual
https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material/authoritative-reports 1/6Unauthorised law reports are legitimate reports that havenʼt gone through the same process
before publication. Tribunals and smaller courts often have unauthorised reports. These can
be the only available reports of those decisions.
Use common abbreviations
for authorised reports

comprises judgments by specific courts and tribunals.
